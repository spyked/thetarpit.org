title: On tar pits (or, the second about)

Humans' understanding of the universe is terrifyingly limited. Yet from
thermodynamics we know (or we think we know) that by the arrow of
entropy nature tends to fall into a general state of disorder. This is
the zeroth tar pit.

The first, second, third and so on up to the nth are most of the things,
beasts, people and phenomena surrounding us, from the actual sticky
thing to more metaphorical notions such as Kafka's perfect bureaucracy,
or just the fat lady standing in front of you at the queue in the post
office.

In the same category lies a tar pit uniquely attributable to man, that
creature more widely (although more and more narrowly) known as Zōon
Politikon. It, like the Boltzmann constant itself, is also difficult to
grasp, but you might know it as that feeling which (naturally!) keeps
you from aspiring to become *more* human. It is laziness; it is
stagnation; it is tiredness, and it is ultimately death.

This blog, my, Lucian Mogoșanu's blog, describes its author's struggle
through his own personal tar pit, as well as accounts and critiques of
some of his times'. I hope I will have at least captured some of the
more interesting ones, much to the amusement of future alien
anthropologists.

The Tar Pit is an ever incomplete and thus necessarily flawed
publication. After all, tar pits might not even be enumerable.
