[Definition][1]: **tar pit**

1. A hollow in which natural tar accumulates by seepage
2. A complicated or difficult situation or problem (e.g. "the tar pit of
municipal poverty")

So, why The Tar Pit? Let's explain this in a quasi-formal language.

Let $P$ be a set, representing all the problems in our universe. Let $K$, a
subset of $P$, be the set of all known problems. Of the problems $p \in K$, a
small part are currently subject to research and of those some will be solved
sooner or later.

However, this is only one of the steps involved in the scientific approach. The
Tar Pit aims in a different, sometimes opposite, direction: creating and
exposing problems, that is, finding problems in $P$ that aren't (yet) in $K$
and discussing problems in $K$ that are worth solving but are grossly
neglected. As [Jacob Bronowski][2] would put it, "That is the essence of
science: ask an impertinent question, and you are on the way to a pertinent
answer". As [Alan Perlis][3] would put it, albeit in a slightly different
context, "Beware of the Turing tar-pit in which everything is possible but
nothing of interest is easy". A word of warning, though: a significant part of
the things written here are half-baked.

Additionally, this is Lucian Mogoșanu's personal blog and thus will contain
all sorts of other things that I find interesting. You can find more about me
on my [about page][4]. To find ways to get in touch with me, see the
