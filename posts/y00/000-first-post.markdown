This is the first post. This is not an introductory post. It is not an attempt
to familiarize the reader with the meaning, scope or purpose of The Tar Pit,
nor is it particularly meaningful in respect to the blog -- indeed, as you
might have already noticed, The Tar Pit is one of the many blogs on the
Internet.

This First post has one meaning, however: it marks the beginning of something
which at this moment eludes the reader, maybe even the author himself. "Hello,
world", it says, "here I am, and there's no turning back". Nothing more.

This is actually the zeroth post.
