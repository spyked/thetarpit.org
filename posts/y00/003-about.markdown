<p style="text-align: right">
*Strangers passing in the street  
By chance two separate glances meet  
And I am you and what I see is me.  
And do I take you by the hand  
And lead you through the land  
[And help me understand][1]  
The best I can.*</p>

The Tar Pit is discussed on [the dedicated page][2].
