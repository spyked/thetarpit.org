*[Hello, Mirror, so glad to see you my friend][1]  
It's been a while*</p>

I am a firm believer in the ideas of Open Source and Free Software, and in the
fact that they can drive the world forward. Closed source software obeys the
Rules of Market: it is born (as a Product), grows, matures, gets old and then,
finally, it dies, and it is then that it becomes lost for all eternity. Open
source software, on the other hand, is in a sense organic: it is born (as an
unpolished piece), grows, matures, gets old, but is never lost, as the almighty
Source will always be there for someone to compile it, or at least reverse
engineer it and then make use of it in some other way.

Thus I believe that Github is one entity that can help drive the world forward,
which is why [I am publishing][2] not only The Tar Pit's content, but also its
plumbing, on Github. Have fun with it!
