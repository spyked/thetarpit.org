This post brings along a few changes to The Tar Pit.

Firstly, the site structure has been modified to accomodate year changes. Posts
can now be found in `posts/yxz/id-postname.html` instead of
`posts/id-postname.html`, where `xz` is a two-digit number, starting with year
00 (equivalent to 2013). I doubt that I will ever write more than 365 posts per
year, and I doubt even more that I will ever write more than 150 posts per
year, while most modern computer file systems can host about 500 to 1000 files
per directory without a significant performance loss in file loading.
Unfortunately, this breaks a few external links I have sent. Fortunately, the
number of broken links is yet small, which is why I've decided to implement
this now rather than later.

Secondly, I downloaded the fonts on Google Fonts locally, for my personal
convenience, as I doubt Google sites will have any significant downtime anytime
soon. I've specified font licenses in a [LICENSE.markdown][1] file. Please
contact me if you see anything wrong there, I'm not too familiar with Legalese.
