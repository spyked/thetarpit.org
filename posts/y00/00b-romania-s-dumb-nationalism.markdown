I was discussing in the footnote of a previous article that, I quote:

The fact is, I was at least partially wrong by assuming that the only (or the
main) reason for that is the "dumb sense of nationalism" of Romanians. The
fundamental reason is in fact Romania's lack of relevant literature, which
makes this nationalism dumb in the first place. And unfortunately, it's not the
only aspect that does.

As you might have probably noticed from my name, I am Romanian and proud to be
so, only not for the reasons invoked by most Romanians. What are these reasons,
then? you might wonder. Let me, for the purpose of enlightening you, enumerate
a couple of them.

First of all, Romanians like to see themselves as an opressed nation from a
historical point of view. They like to believe that the Dacians who inhabited
Romania's geographical space 2000+ years ago were somehow "oppressed" by Romans
after Trajan's Dacian wars, when in fact historical sources show that Dacian
rulers were nothing but meddlers into the affairs of the Roman Empire, so they
were bound to get burned sooner or later[^1]. Served them right, I say.
Romanians also view the so-called "Romanian states"[^2] as oppressed either by
the Hungarians or by the Ottoman Empire, and as gatekeepers for the so-called
"gates of Europe", a fact which is false, given that the Ottoman Empire invaded
Vienna without any resistance from the "Romanian states". What's more
outrageous is that Wallachian and Moldavian rulers were nothing but docile
puppets put to rule by the Ottomans themselves, that is, until the Russians
intervened and gave us a kick in the ass to give the Turks a kick in the
ass[^3].

TL;DR, the history of "Romanians", a nation called so by the guys that came up
with this dumb nationalism in the first place in the first half of the 1800s.
Inspired by an adventurer in the second half of the 16th century called Mihai
Viteazu ("Michael The Brave"), who messed with European powers (much like
Burebista before him), attained power over the three "Romanian states" for a
short time and then got murdered, they decided that since there are people who
speak the same language in all the three regions, these just had to be united.
Who cared about the ethnic and cultural diversity of the entire northern
Balkans and who the heck cared about the opposing interests of said regions and
powers that influenced them? Apparently no one, so they somehow managed to pull
two unions, which some Romanians [opposed at their respective times][1]. But
I'll have to give them credit, they managed it, it was something pretty damn
big, unlike many previous "victories".

Secondly, Romanians have this bad habit of taking various famous persons of
Romanian origin and calling them Romanian. Local newspapers made a campaign
called "De ce iubesc Romania" ("Why I love Romania")[^4], related to this.
However, Ștefan Odobleja, the scientist, was *not* Romanian, since he
discovered proto-cybernetics in France. Henri Coandă was *not* Romanian, since
he did most of his work in France, Belgium and Germany. Eugène Ionesco was
*not* Romanian, as he spent most of his life in France. Victor Babeș, a
well-known name in biology and medical sciences, was *not* Romanian, as he made
most of his breakthroughs abroad. Need I go on? Sure, they might have been born
in Romania, they might have had Romanian citizenship, but the fact is, Romania
never did anything to help them make their discoveries. The most it did was
give them a kick in the proverbial butt and drive them abroad, where these
highly gifted people could innovate. But no, not in Romania, because Romania
always had other priorities. Sure, this country has been, is and most probably
will be a source of great minds. I'm really not sure, I think it must be a
fluke or something.

Despite all this, and I feel the need to repeat myself, I am proud to be
Romanian.  I was born and raised here, I've lived a fairly good life so far,
so, as a personal view, Romania is a pretty cool country, although sometimes it
doesn't really seem much of a *country*. Also, I've met Romanians that are
good, honest people and I'm sure I'll meet many more, which gives me the hope
this nation (also known as "we") has the chance of reedeeming itself, and that
is mostly by growing up and out of our stupidity and acknowledging our sorry
past.

[^1]: Don't believe me, read for yourself and prove me that my interpretation
was wrong.
[^2]: Moldavia, Wallachia and Transylvania, the latter actually part of
Hungary, Habsburg Empire and so on.
[^3]: And to our surprise this we did, without much help from the Russians.
[^4]: An incorrect Romanian title, since it lacks diacritics. The correct
spelling would have been "De ce iubesc România". And y'know, we're talking
about the name of the country they claim to love. It's not malice, it's sheer
incompetence, as per Hanlon's razor.
