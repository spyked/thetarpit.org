**November 14, 2013** -- [EU to offer a perspective to Moldova][1]:

> [...]
>
> "Our government, like most of the people, has chosen the way of civilization
> and European integration," Corman told an audience in Berlin. "We're on the
> right path; we've introduced many reforms, especially in the fight against
> corruption and in the justice system. We are not a risk for the EU."

**November 27, 2013** -- [Ukraine signs oil, gas deal with Eni and EDF, sees $4 billion investment][2]

**November 28, 2013** -- [Romania to Seek Reunification with Moldova][3]:

> Romanian President Traian Basescu has revealed that his country is to seek a
> reunification with neighboring Moldova. 
>
> "I am convinced that if "unionist winds" start to blow in Moldova, Romania
> will always be ready for that. Accession to NATO was once a fundamental
> project for Romania. There was also another one - accession to the EU. I
> think that the third fundamental project should become our unification with
> Moldova. There can be no doubt about that," Basescu told Romania's TVR-1, as
> cited by Interfax.

**November 29, 2013** -- [Ukraine Faces E.U.’s Dismay on Turnabout on Accords][4]:

> [...]
>
> Ms. Merkel, holding a glass of white wine, stood in front of Mr. Yanukovich,
> a beefy man who is at least a head taller. “We see you here,” said Ms.
> Merkel, nodding her head and giving a disapproving shrug. “But we expected
> more.” Next to her, Ms. Grybauskaite nodded in assent. Mr. Yanukovich had
> nowhere to turn.

> [...]

**December 1, 2013** -- [Romania's National Day][5]

**December 2, 2013** -- [Chevron resumes east Romanian shale gas search][6]:

> U.S. oil major Chevron has resumed its search for shale gas in eastern
> Romania, it said on Monday, despite opposition from local residents.
>
> In October the company won approval to drill exploratory wells in the small
> town of Pungesti in the impoverished eastern county of Vaslui but had to halt
> works soon after as local residents blocked access to the site.

**December 2, 2013** -- [Frum: Beware Russia's power play in Ukraine][7]:

> [...]
>
> Since Putin's entry into power, Russia minus Ukraine has sought to influence
> and corrupt the democracies of Europe. A Russia that reintegrated Ukraine
> would possess the power -- like the Soviet Union of old -- to intimidate and
> bully democratic Europe. Russia minus Ukraine can aspire to become a normal
> nation state, a democracy, even a liberal democracy. A Russia that holds
> Ukraine by force must forever be a militarized authoritarian regime, a menace
> to its own people as much as to the rest of the European continent and the
> democratic world.
>
> [...]
>
> Don't be fooled by the muted words, however. What's at stake in the streets
> of Kiev is the future of the European continent -- and American prosperity
> and security. An inward-looking America is averting its attention from its
> own most important interests and highest ideals.

**December 4, 2013** -- [The battle over Ukraine: Towards a new geopolitical game][8]:

> This is quite a turnaround in German policies towards Russia. It is the first
> time Merkel has spoken to Moscow with the assertive attitude of the leader of
> a great power. And she was doing what great powers usually do: pushing back
> other great powers and offering protection to smaller powers.
>
> In other words, Merkel took a first step towards a geopolitical competition
> with Russia over Eastern Europe -- effectively ending years of cozy bilateral
> relations with Moscow.
>
> Merkel has picked up the gauntlet thrown by Putin at her and the EU. But it
> is still unclear to what extent she will follow-up her rhetoric and push the
> EU towards making more substantial offers to Ukraine -- especially after the
> hopes of signing an agreement at the Vilnius summit have been disappointed.
>
> But she has shown a Germany that no longer afraid to confront Russia over
> Eastern Europe.  This is starting to look like an entirely new game.

**December 5, 2013** -- [Moldovans now officially speak Romanian][9]:

> The Constitutional Court ruled Thursday the country's official language
> should be changed to "Romanian" from "Moldovan."
>
> [...]
>
> Moldova's remaining Communists opposed the change.
>
> In neighboring Romania, officials welcomed the decision. President Traian
> Basescu called it "an act of justice."

> The International Monetary Fund's executive board will likely postpone until
> March a meeting to discuss Romania's progress under a 2-billion-euro ($2.74
> billion) loan program, after the Romanian president refused to endorse some
> of the measures included in the latest policy package, news agency Mediafax
> reported.
>
> [...]
>
> "We are aware of President Traian Basescu's disagreement with the government
> over the specific measures. The IMF staff is monitoring developments and is

> policies needed to secure the agreed deficit target, before submitting the

> Ukraine's opposition, preparing for what it hopes will be a gigantic protest
> rally on Sunday, says it will negotiate with President Viktor Yanukovych only

> European integration.
>
> [...]
>
> Russia wants Ukraine to join a customs union also including Belarus and
> Kazakhstan that would be a counterweight to the EU and put pressure on
> Yanukovych to shelve the EU agreement.
>
> Yatsenyuk called the customs union "a new version of the Soviet Union."
>
> Distress over the customs was high after Yanukovych and Russian President
> Vladimir Putin met on Friday. The leaders' offices on Saturday said the
> presidents didn't discuss the customs union, but suspicions persisted.
>
> "It was clear that (Yanukovych's) way to the European Union was blocked from
> the start," Yatsenyuk said. "It was a big auction — who is to buy Ukraine."
