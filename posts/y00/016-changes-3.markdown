I am not a graphical designer. If I were one, I would be mediocre at best. Now,
if we take a step back to get an overview of how the Web looks after almost
twenty-five years of evolution, we'll figure out that this position is actually
not bad at all and could possibly earn someone a decent salary. Still, I'd be
constantly unsettled with my mediocrity and would die a sorry, unhappy man.

[Having said that][1], a couple of months ago I had a good look at [the
previous iteration][2] of The Tar Pit and decided that I didn't quite like how
it looked. It wasn't that bad, yet it didn't look particularly good either.
That is why I had to take my time and figure out where I'm heading with it; and
here it is.

One of the things I'm trying to do is use CSS the way it was intended, as much
as it is possible. Therefore I deemed the previous layout to be "not simple
enough" and removed a lot of the boilerplate lying around in the code and
replaced it with simpler, more down-to-earth stuff. This should be visible
mainly in the page loading times; they should have been small enough anyway,
but I just wanted to make sure. As an intended side effect, I made an update to
aspects related to the fonts, which in retrospective might have been a
particularly bad choice. If you had any doubts that I'm not a graphical
designer, they should be cleared by now.

Regarding the site's structure, two things were fundamentally misplaced in the
previous version(s). The first was the content of the home page, which for some
reason included labels only because I didn't know where else to put them.
Labels are now part of the [archive][3], although I still use them more for
semantic annotation than for actual archiving.

The second obvious problem was related to the Contact page: on one hand it
lacked content and on the other it had possibly relevant information requiring
an additional click from the reader. So the content from that page lies now in
a dedicated section of the home page.

As I was saying [a while ago][4], The Tar Pit is, like any software, supposed
to evolve, grow organically and mature, which I have a feeling it slowly does.
And I am quite happy with that, at least for the time being.
