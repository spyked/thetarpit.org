This article works under the assumption that religions in general have slowly
evolved into mashups of ancient philosophical concepts and cultural habits that
are presented as timeless but which are in fact terribly outdated. The
relevance of the centerpiece of religion (i.e. the all-knowing God) will
largely be ignored here, although I will not fully discard it. Thus we will
take [Merriam-Webster][1] and use the definition of religion as a starting
point:

> re·li·gion
>
> - the belief in a god or in a group of gods
> - an organized system of beliefs, ceremonies, and rules used to worship a god
> or a group of gods
> - an interest, a belief, or an activity that is very important to a person or
> group

Note that I lean more on the third definition than on the former two, since I
believe that while a religion may be founded on the belief in a supernatural
being, it is at least as important to consider the cultural and habitual
aspects of religion. In other words, I can personally take the all-powerful and
supernatural out of "God says that X" or "We do Y to please God" without
depriving said sentences of meaning. I admit that I could be wrong in my
assumption, but ignoring it would involve ignoring my own beliefs, something
which no person of integrity would find acceptable. I shall thus proceed to the
subject.

My previous research on what I call "post-religion" has so far yielded nothing,
or at least nothing that I would find interesting. In any case, I hope that I'm
not reinventing the wheel, or that I'm doing it through an approach that people
will find relevant, to say the least. Either way, my main challenge is to
define post-religion and illustrate it with examples.

I ended one of my previous posts called "[Religion and the closed world
assumption][2]" on the following note:

This idea stems from deep, philosophical questions such as "what is God?" or
"what is it that we are worshipping?". If we consider for example Christianity,
it is intuitively clear that it was the main focus of the cultural and social
life during the fall of the Roman Empire(s) and later during the Dark Ages,
though we might not be able to provide much historical backing on the latter.
Thus books were mainly focused on telling tales of Christ and God and whatnot,
while social activities, e.g. music, were focused on praising some form of God.
I wouldn't go as far as to speculate that secular activities were rare, but
once again, it's pretty clear that *religious* activities were commonplace.

This is one aspect of religion that has changed during our modern and
post-modern times. Activities are now equivalent to little boxes: when we
pursue something, we take a box, open it, enjoy its contents, then put them
back into the box for later consumption[^1]. Religion becomes thus but a box in
this context, but a brick in the wall, but something people turn to in their
time of need. This doesn't apply at all to fundamentalist religions, which are
very much like Christianity was a millenium ago. It however applies fully to
the Western civilization, the same civilization that in the 20th century
embraced this "box-based" thinking along with something called the pop
culture. This is essentially what I call *post-religion*.

In other words I define *post-religion* as the worship or religious attachement
to things other than an omniscient, supernatural God. Said things come to
define our (sub-)culture and our habits, defining our selves as post-religious
persons.

The definition is as simple as it is outrageous. Let us then attempt to apply
it to some real-life examples:

**Hollywood, TV shows, books and the music industry**: The term "fan" has
become widely used in the last few decades. It's somehow fairly normal to be "a
fan of X", where X is a music band or an author, book, movie, genre or whatever
other product of pop culture. Little do people realize, although they know it,
that the word comes from "fanatic", which fanaticism can be indeed observed
amongst admirers[^2].

As an exception, some people have been known to die over their favourite X. As
a common occurence, people gather in groups to worship their X, be it at
conventions, concerts or in smaller gatherings. This is not dissimilar to
Sunday masses, same as christening is not dissimilar to various rites happening
in so-called "fraternities". I don't feel it necessary to expand the example
further.

**Sports**: Interestingly, what started out as a play on war now ends up as a
kind of adoration. Seen from a distant perspective, it is a strange ritual
where people lazily get fat by eating junk and watching the war instead of
actively participating in it. In reality it's no big deal, as the vulgus were
fed the same "bread and circus" shortly before the fall of the Roman Empire.

On the opposite extreme, there are those who religiously practice otherwise
innocent hobbies such as skiing, working out or running.

**Eating habits**: It's one thing to struggle keeping oneself from the clutches
of food corporations, i.e. the post-religion of McDonaldism, and another to be
a "vegetarian", or better, a "raw vegan". Traditionally, people have consumed
whatever food they could, given their geographical position. This would
reinforce the idea that post-religions arise out of modern constructs such as
the free market.

Special mention: **pseudo-scientism**.

I note here that the space of post-religions is too big to explore exhaustively
and these examples fulfill their role of illustrative objects very well.
Basically post-religions have become a cornerstone for our contemporary
civilization. In fact we could argue that post-religion itself has become such
a cornerstone. One might wonder whether or not this foundation is not too
shallow and/or fragile to sustain it. Either way, it would seem that we all
need our gods to worship.

[^1]: This point on how people generally view "activities" could be argued. An
example that stands out in its favour is Facebook, which organizes such
concepts into "life events". Another trivial one is "work" versus "leisure".
There are probably a million others. Either way, I am fully aware that
"activities" might be an oversimplification.

[^2]: Also called "beliebers" in one particular case.
