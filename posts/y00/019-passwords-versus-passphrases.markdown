A while ago Randall Munroe posted a comic called "Password Strength":

<span><a href="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/password_strength.png"><img

This sparked a lot of debate on the Internet. Although the math seems right,
after skimming through the discussions on the [XKCD forums][1] and on [Stack
Exchange][2], the whole thing has left me a bit skeptical, not as far as the
mathematical matters go as much as on the assumptions on which the comic
relies.

Scientifical papers on security[^1] idiomatically define a so-called "attacker
model", from which they derive assumptions about how someone will attempt to
crack some particular computing system, in our case an arbitrary password-based
authentication system. Now that we're done with the boring stuff, it's safe to
say that assuming that any mildly experienced script kiddie will attempt a
brute-force before a dictionary attack is completely nonsense.

Now, as per the comic and the previously stated analyses, a passphrase should at
least in theory make a dictionary attack *weaker*, since it increases the
word-level entropy, turning it into a brute-force attack at word-level. More
exactly, for an alphabet $\Sigma$ and a password $p$ of $l(p)$ elements from
$\Sigma$, the brute-forcing complexity is

$C(p) = \left|{\Sigma}\right|^{l(p)}$

where $\left|{\cdot}\right|$ denotes set cardinality.

I'll illustrate this by using the word count of the `/usr/share/dict/words` in
my distribution[^2]:

~~~~ {.bash}
% wc -l /usr/share/dict/words
99171 /usr/share/dict/words
~~~~

The main difference between classical brute-forcing and a "brute-force
dictionary" is that while the first uses as a basis a fixed alphabet (i.e. the
printable ASCII charset plus-minus some Unicode) and a large exponent (i.e. the
password length), the second relies solely on growing the alphabet's size.

So for word-level bruteforcing, we'll have:

$C_w(p) = \left|{\Sigma_w}\right|^{l_w(p)} = 99171^4$

where $\Sigma_w$ is a word-based alphabet and $l_w(p)$ is the number of
words in a passphrase $p$.

In contrast, for a character-based alphabet $\Sigma_c$ for which
$\left|{\Sigma_c}\right| = 26$, the password length yielding the equivalent
complexity would have to be about $l_c(p) = 14.1243217044885998$, give or take
a few decimal places.

One thing that I attempted to do was to find the "correct horse" passphrase's
strength in relation to a smaller dictionary, which led me to the "tiny"
dictionary from [Openwall][3], of about 250 words. Interestingly enough, it
seems that none of the words chosen for the passphrase given in the comic are
in that dictionary, which would make [words][4] a pretty strong source of
random words, assuming that the underlying random number generator is strong
enough.

This is however only the beginning of a long, possibly neverending, intricate
story. As passphrases become more common, I will venture to guess that "simply
random" might not be enough and that some form of strong randomness will be
required. For example, one might need to check that a given passphrase cannot
be guessed by a Markov text generator based on the probability distribution
inferred from, say, all the pages of Wikipedia. Natural language passphrases
such as [Assange's published password][5] are thus becoming increasingly weak
while password strength metrics vary more and more based on the attacker model.

[^1]: A thing which XKCD is most definitely not. Despite the fact that Munroe
has educated opinions on the subjects he touches in his comics, the latter
should always be taken with a grain of salt, however "interesting" they may
seem.
