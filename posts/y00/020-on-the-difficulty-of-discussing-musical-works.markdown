Back in the day when I was writing in Romanian, and this is something of which
the post-spyked-bricks-in-the-wall readers might be completely unaware of,
I was, like any melomaniac, discussing music on the blog. [Everything][1] from
[jazz][2] to [progressive rock][3] had a place there, and for a while I had
felt that I just *had* to put my musical experiences into words.
Uncoincidentally, my music intake was gigantic for something like six years in
a row, so maintaining some sort of journal on the matter was actually quite
inspired, and somehow inspiring.

But I must admit that at some point the whole thing started bothering me.

In the last couple of years I started listening to fewer musical works, partly
due to a lack of the capacity to focus derived from my increasingly busy
schedule, and partly due to my desire to grasp the depth of the music I was
consuming. As you might know, progressive rock and jazz aren't particularly
easy genres, and I've started complementing them with classical works, as well
as whatever new "releases" I found interesting[^1].

This being said, I found (and still do) that keeping a musical journal
continues to make sense. However, my latest journal entries failed to cover
the actual depth of the music I'm involving myself with. Admittedly, this
might partly account for my lack of formal musical background, although I have
composed music in the past and I'm able to understand the underlying
complexity of various musical works. What is more confusing is that while
looking into "more professional" writings such as those supposedly made by
[Prog Archives'][4] reviewers, I tend to see the same shallow approach to
music analysis that plagues my own. And this is what made it even *more*
bothersome.

I therefore postulate that discussing music is inherently hard, as hard as
discussing love or beauty, or virtues or good, or even existence itself.
Indeed, we seldom think of the nature of love while we become attached to
someone, yet this doesn't make it any less dumbfounding; and that is, after
all, what makes love so hard to put into words. The same goes for music.

From a purely mechanical point of view, music is but a sequence of sound waves
which occur in such a way that they are processed by our auditory system to be
interpreted as "likeable". This definition may be considered by some to be too
broad, since then I would consider mere words spoken by a woman to be music;
this is, in fact, not too far from the truth, given the expression "music to
my ears". The hard fact is that humans grow to develop an affinity for certain
sound patterns, with the possibility of cultural relativism: what I find to be
music, you might find to be noise and vice-versa.

But then we could approach music from an abstract point of view; it, as many
other (physical or otherwise) phenomena occuring in nature, can be described in
mathematical terms, or, to quote Leibniz:

>  The pleasure we obtain from music comes from counting, but counting
>  unconsciously. Music is nothing but unconscious arithmetic.

Any person with basic musical training can confirm this: scales, modes and the
circle of fifths are all part of a mathematical framework used to make sense
of how musical "notes" happen, and all this without even discussing rhythm.
Furthermore, musical notation is a purely formal construct, not unlike
standard mathematical notation, which leads us to the possibility of
describing music as algebra. It is very much a miracle, if you will, and [one
that matters][5].

There is, however, a third point of view, which the reader might have failed
to consider, but which I notice daily in the spring when I open my window:
music is a language, or rather a set of languages considered by many musicians
to be universal[^2], despite the aforementioned cultural relativism. We often
tell ourselves that birds "sing" when in fact they communicate, but it's not
so often that we tell ourselves that we communicate through music, when we in
fact do precisely that. The proof is trivial: music has an alphabet and, oh,
so many grammars which send some kind of message, or tell a story, like B.B.
King likes to say; one which we understand only subconsciously.

And therein lies the difficulty: describing a song's deep(ly) musical message
would require us to translate that message into English or some other human
language, and that is, I argue, impossible, since we don't, and can't, because
we have no means to understand deep(ly) musical messages in terms of human
language.

Let's take Mussorgsky's "Pictures at an Exhibition" as an example. The suite
gives a detailed musical account of an exhibition of Viktor Hartmann's
paintings, being split into sections accordingly. Now, our greatest luck as
listeners is that the author has annotated his work, while the [extra
commentary][6] describes the meaning of each movement. On the other hand, if
we were to give the raw suite to a child without providing them with any extra
information about the song[^3], their own unadulterated interpretation would
be nothing close to that.

Generalizing, I am arguing that the author's subjective interpretation of
a musical piece has, in fact, no relationship whatsoever with the public's
interpretation, or, more exactly, with the billions possible interpretations.
Thus we can't naïvely assume that there is in fact a one-to-one mapping
between the language of a song and human language, let alone a mapping between
the language(s) of many songs and the latter. In fact we can't assume that
there is any mapping at all.

Having said that, I find it extremely difficult to write about my own musical
experiences anymore, although they are now as rich as ever, if not richer.
Granted, I'm not sure they were ever useful to anyone except myself, but all
I can do is hope that I'll get to explore some new (or old!) music in writing
in the future.

[^1]: Looking at things in perspective, I observe that "albums" are a stupid
format to release to the public. One would have thought that Internet would
free us from the need to have $x$ songs in $n$ minutes, but alas, old habits
die hard.

[^2]: Not unlike mathematics, by the way.

[^3]: This is bound to happen when you're in a bar or a pub and you hear "that
song" and then you have no idea how to find it afterwards. If it weren't for
Shazam and whatnot...
