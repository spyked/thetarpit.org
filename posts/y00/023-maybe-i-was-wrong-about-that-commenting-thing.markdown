Almost a year ago, back when The Tar Pit had just ceased to be a collection of
ideas on a whiteboard, I delved into [technical details][1] related to
blogging; mind you, nothing as philosophical as "why blog?"[^1], but rather a
discussion on the right tools and the right approaches for blogging. While I
never implied that the way I considered doing it was the right approach for
everyone, I was back then fairly sure that the technical tidbits behind The
Tar Pit were not only the right way, but that they were the only feasible
approach for myself.

One specifically bothersome detail was the issue of comments:

More simply put, commenting platforms, especially the proprietary
"in-the-cloud" ones, are a bitch. They either make it considerably difficult to
moderate content, due to the horrendous amount of spam (as seen in Wordpress),
or they lock your data into their services, a fact that I for one find
unacceptable, to say the least. Thus my idea involved delegating commenting to
whatever platforms lie on the Internet, closed or otherwise, given that
historically speaking, my blogs haven't received much "engagement" from their
readers anyway[^2].

Of course, that didn't really work. So far, exactly zero people have contacted
me on The Tar Pit's [e-mail][4], and only a few people have discussed the
blog's subjects with me on social networks and other public forums, although
others may have been discussing them among themselves, who knows. On one hand,
people prefer to do it the "convenient" way rather than the "right" way. On the
other, Facebook is one example of a [completely useless][5] publishing
platform, while Twitter's 140-character limit encourages only linking, not
discussions. I haven't really tried posting my writings on Reddit and the likes
and I'm not planning to, but feel free to do that if you think it's a good
idea.

Now, while I'm living in my own writer's bubble, Robin Ward (also known as Evil
Trout) comes and announces that [Discourse][6] can now be embedded in static
sites. This is of course very dissimilar to the classical way of commenting:
you can view comments on the blog, but you have to actually access a forum to
post comments, implying that you also need to make a virtual identity, i.e. a
user, and become part of a community. Anonymous posting is thus turned off by
default, a fact which I don't wholeheartedly agree with[^3].

I've thought about this long before creating The Tar Pit, and I must admit that
it is an interesting concept. It's also one that might not work here, since
creating a community around a single blog would require that blog to be more
active (I write 0.5 to 1 post per week on average), and it would also require a
critical mass of posts and/or categories. People wouldn't gather there simply
because they're readers of The Tar Pit, but because they'd have found something
worth debating, which I am skeptical of.

Despite my skepticism, I will confess that maybe I was wrong about that thing
about commenting. Maybe this Discourse thing is indeed the right tool to
enable commenting on arbitrary (non-Wordpress) blogs, maybe even my blog. And
even if it isn't, maybe it's worth trying to use it and failing, I'm sure the
experience itself would count. I don't agree with [Jeff Atwood][6] that "a
blog without comments is not a blog", but it is definitely *less* of a blog,
which I guess The Tar Pit is.

I can't say I'm ready to give this a try yet, but who knows, sometime, in the
future, maybe...

[^1]: [Steve Yegge][2] has already discussed the subject rather well, in my
opinion.

[^2]: While I'm aware that we live in the age of "virals", "user experience",
"engagement" and other such mildly annoying buzzwords, I find this phenomenon
to be perfectly normal for my personal blog. I hardly expect that a massive
number of users read The Tar Pit, simply because I deal in more or less
esoteric subjects. Moreover, I hardly expect most of my readers to "engage" in
discussing the content, since I've given up writing stuff that will stir up
sensation. The reason is quite simple: asking for attention in a time when it
(that is, attention) is so expensive, and when attention deficit is so
widespread, is simply wrong. Either you read this or you don't. To put it in
the words of [Simon Peyton-Jones][3], I'm avoiding success at all costs.

[^3]: It solves the spam problem by default, though.
