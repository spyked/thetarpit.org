Three years ago I wrote an essay entitled
"[un argument împotriva corectitudinii politice][1]", loosely translatable as
"An argument against political correctness". Said essay starts with the Google
dictionary definition of the term "political correctness", which I shall
re-introduce here:

> the avoidance, often considered as taken to extremes, of forms of expression
> or action that are perceived to exclude, marginalize, or insult groups of
> people who are socially disadvantaged or discriminated against.

It is worth noting that the definition has been revised since then. Firstly,
the current definition acknowledges the danger of extremism implied by
political correctness, a revision which I, for one, find very
pleasing. Secondly, it explicitly mentions "disadvantage" and "discrimination"
as two possible issues addressed by political correctness.

I shall in the paragraphs that follow attempt a complete rewrite, since the
translation would prove to be inaccurate[^1]. I also feel the need to mention
that this essay focuses on political correctness as a linguistic tool more
than anything else, mostly because I find myself both fascinated and scared by
this particular aspect.

## The case against political correctness

Be aware, dear reader, that I write to you in what the educated Englishman
would consider to be broken English, but I write frankly. Notice how I said
"Englishman" and not "Englishperson", not because I have anything against women
-- on the contrary --, but because I found it most natural; maybe it's just
that language evolves and mine will prove to remain a relic, but I will be here
to make my case for as long as I live.

This case probably deserves a historical background. I am however poorly
equipped with the knowledge for this, so I will keep it brief: the sexual (and
whatnot) revolution of the '60s gave birth, among others, to rather peculiar,
although entirely understandable, political movements in the States. Women,
despite not being a minority, felt the need to assert their status as persons,
followed by other social groups who felt now that they could strongly stand
for whatever it is that they believed in. Note that many people were, as
people usually are, unkeen to adhere to these new beliefs, especially due to
the fact that they weren't theirs, but the minorities'. Many people still are
now, half a century later, despite the strong propaganda occuring in the
mass-media.

Since we're discussing communication, this phenomenon was followed by an even
more peculiar one: given the new person-status of persons in said social
groups, some people, a very vocal crowd, felt the need to also change all the
terms pertaining to the denigration of women, black people, gay people, and so
on, and so forth: it is nowadays forbidden to call an African American a
"nigger"[^2], although that word is, in all honesty, part of their heritage.
You see, here in uncivilized Romania, we call Gypsies "Gypsies", because that's
who they are, and it is fortunate of them that they are really proud of their
heritage. On the other hand, this indeed has the unfortunate side effect of
creating an inter-ethnical, maybe even inter-"cultural" clash, but that's only
because Gypsies are very resilient to the cultural brainwashing which Western
people like to call "integration".

The problem with this linguistic mashup is that not only it's completely
artificial, but it is also very dangerous from a moral and ethical point of
view, in that it creates false morals. To quote Orwell once more, it is akin
to creating a "Newspeak", a language where concepts are disguised as
different, sometimes completely opposite, terms. And while this is used to
support the "good guys", let us remember that the same tactics were used by
the bad guys in the past: let's not call it a slaughterhouse, call it a
"concentration camp"; let's not call it slavework, call it "re-education". As
Orwell and Vonnegut very well noticed, this is nothing but politicians' false
pretenses to their own ends.

The problem with political correctness is also that it creates false problems:
for example, feminists state there aren't enough women working in the IT
industry, when there should be, and companies should somehow magically,
forcefully, bring women to work there. Yes, maybe "tech companies", or
engineering companies in general, are populated with male pigs suffering of
superiority complex, but this doesn't imply stuff about women in any way[^3].
The only "achievement" this mindset brings is that it grossly misrepresents the
causal chain: if we wish for equality so much, then why aren't there more
female construction workers? Ah, because we don't educate them to? There you
go.

Finally, based on this train of ideas, I argue that political correctness is
inheretly harmful, because it paves the way for what I would call a
generalization of the Stockholm syndrome: a harsh reality covered in and by
pretty words, solely for the desire of being less hateful to one another, like
hate is the only problem, and like we don't have the right to hate[^4]. It is,
in the end, brainwashing for the sake of "equality".

Quasi-theoretical arguments are, however, not valuable by themselves. I will
therefore attempt to provide a case study in order to further express my point
of view and make it clearer, and then I will let you, dear reader, reflect
upon this and develop your own point of view.

## A not-so-thorough case study

You might remember the Brendan Eich scandal from April this year. In case you
don't know who Brendan Eich is, I'll clear that up for you: he's the guy who
created Javascript, the one and only client-side scripting language available
on the web today. No matter how awesome or awful the language might be, he
basically wrote the book, made history, call it whatever you like.

According to official sources[^5], Eich occupied his rightful place as CEO of
the Mozilla Corporation for exactly one week and three days. Sometime during
this timeframe, voices had discussed a political donation made by Eich for some
law or another which seeked to invalidate gay marriage rights in some US state
or another, which, I suppose, would lead one to believe that Eich hates gays.
The outcry and political pressure spawned by this was impressive, and while
being gay or pro-gay or anti-gay has nothing to do with his merits as a CEO, he
was effectively forced to resign.

Now, my educated view of this unfortunate event tells me that Brendan Eich has
a lot of enemies. Whatever his personal life is, this was used by people who
don't exactly like him in order to bring him down right at his moment of peak
and, if possible, to completely break him as a man who's in a perfectly
legitimate position. This evil, if I may call it so, was no different from
forcing someone to leave somewhere due to religious beliefs or you name it,
since those are nothing but his personal beliefs and views of the world,
whatever they may be. What happened was the perfect strawman, the kind of
tribal behaviour that never occurs in the civilized world.

On another note, activists who are pro-some-group-or-another like to perform
"public shaming" on all "straight white males" on various social networks, on
the false premise of positive discrimination, stating that people born in a
social group or another are somehow indebted to people born in some other
social group, which I suppose goes back to the Christian sophism that we all
bear Adam and Eve's sins. One such attack is the harassement of Notch[^6] on
[Twitter][5] on the basis that he didn't do enough to help
some-group-or-another in his games. Others include the rantings of artists whom
I otherwise admire[^7], who try to impose that art ["oughta" consider][6] some
or other views, otherwise it "oughta" cease to be viewed as such, like people
actually give a damn about what anyone else thinks art "oughta" be.

Finally, I feel compelled to remark the hypocrisy that comes along with all the
politically correct nonsense: Coca Cola got [publicly burned][7] in a recent ad
promoting diversity, multiculturalism and other such values that "oughta
matter" to this Brave New World, albeit in a manner which doesn't promote
"positive discrimination" and political attitudes. This goes to show that
modern tribalism considers that it's ok, no, that it's better to be a black gay
woman, just as long as you're not a brown muslim arab who doesn't speak
English.

And no, it doesn't matter that [you have a Phd][8]. Your political correctness
is a proverbial Auschwitz of minds, and it's killing me.

[^1]: Tried it, didn't work.

[^2]: If I were an American, right now I would have been impaled or something.
Fortunately for me, I'm not one.

[^3]: Do you know any women saying that they don't want to do programming
because programmers are emotionally broken? Neither do I, and maybe that's
because women have no idea of how programmers are when they decide to become
programmers (or not) and the former would rather avoid it because [they like
barbie dolls][2], or something equally un-programmer-ly.

[^4]: For the record, ideologically speaking, the opposite of "the right to
hate" is forcing people to "live in harmony", which is another term for
fascism.

[^5]: [Mozilla Leadership Changes][3], [Brendan Eich Steps Down as Mozilla
CEO][4]

[^6]: The guy who made Minecraft and some other equally neat games.

[^7]: Say, Dresden Codak's Aaron Diaz, who's only one of the many who fight
fire with fire by overusing the "straight white male" crap in their public
discourse.
