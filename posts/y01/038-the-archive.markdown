The following is a loose translation of a short essay published about three
years ago on the [old blog][bricks] in Romanian. Bear with me here, for its
style of writing is, I believe, less succinct and more jocular than what you're
used to reading on The Tar Pit. I would never publish it, however, if I didn't
think the content wasn't relevant in some way or another.

They say of the Great Library of Alexandria that it was the vastest and most
important repository of knowledge in Ancient history, at least until the Romans
came and burned it. Unfortunately there wasn't a Second Library of Alexandria,
or at least a Second Library of $X$, where $X \neq \text{Alexandria}$, which
would contain backup copies of all the burned books; and if it had existed,
then they would have burned it a second time before the scribes had the time to
make new copies.

Fortunately for us, modern civilization had something to learn from that and
by mere chance the Internet appeared out of nowhere, an Internet which keeps
on growing seemingly without end. And of course, like monkeys that don't see
the forest because of the trees, we imagine that Internets exist exclusively
to serve our lusts, fetishes and thirst for communication and connection and
other crap. Might be, I'm not arguing that, but the fact is that (another)
important purpose of the Internet is quite similar to that of the library
mentioned above, a function which I dubbed the "humanity's informational
archive™"[^1].

It being such an archive, one of the Internet's main purposes is that of
archiving, that is, keeping information as intact as it is possible, that is,
as close to the way it looked when it was initially generated. In order for it
to fulfill this role, the Internet's infrastructure readily comprises fault
tolerance mechanisms at multiple levels, from RAID technologies to higher level
protocols such as BitTorrent[^2].

Additionally our internetic library fulfills a purpose that goes two ways:
ensuring free access to information, a function that is successfully
implemented by the Internet in its actual form, and ensuring scalability and
the facilitation of continuous update, so that the network will naturally
evolve and won't crumble under its own weight. Both are necessary conditions
for the existence of the humanity's informational archive™; the first because
a library that does not allow free access cannot be replicated until the
Romans come to burn it, thus it faces the greater risk of disappearing; the
second because as time passes, an incomplete archive would not be worthy of
being called such.

While ensuring the system's scalability is a purely technical matter which
might prove to bring forth interesting challenges in the future[^3], the
continuous update of Internet happens in a way such that it can be
continuized[^4], as I'm now writing a post, $X$ writes yet another and
meanwhile millions of people publish stuff on various social networks -- let
me humour you by saying that Facebook's Timeline actually serves a
well-defined purpose.

It might be that you, dear reader, haven't considered this aspect, but it has
huge repercussions on the history of the human race. The properties mentioned
above guarantee that history will be remembered with a degree of accuracy we
haven't seen until now, as the smallest details about the most unimportant
individual will exist somewhere and will be a great sight for the people in the
year 252525, who will laugh their asses off[^5] at stuff that nowadays are dead
serious to us.

Getting back to the initial idea, we know that modern technology now allows us
to fill the humanity's informational archive™ with content comprising text,
audio, video and... that's about it. I'm fairly sure that I'm not lying when I
say that these three forms of expression comprise but a small part of our
lives. So how will you, for example, get to record olfactory-gustatory data of
your culinary recipes, to be later compared by your great-grandchildren with
what they'll have had then? Well, you can't do that. How will you store that
intense orgasm that you had when you made fierce love with Jocelyn? Who
wouldn't want to relive such a moment later in their lives, or, yet again, to
hope that the weirdos in 252525 will have some terms for comparison[^6]? Nope,
this kind of thing isn't technically achievable for now.

So for now the question remains: will we get to interact with the Internet in
this manner in the next hundred of years? Stay tuned and you shall find out.

[^1]: So yeah, Justin Bieber and Kim Kardashian are part of the great mass of
information that humanity has to offer. Just ask Google and Facebook.

[^2]: So in the great scheme of things it would seem that piracy is doing a
great service to humanity. There, you've read it here, out of context, but not
out of importance.

[^3]: For example we can barely speculate about the possibility of extending
the Internet at an interplanetary scale, although we can freely speculate
regarding its necessity in the (quite very) possible case when that happens.

[^4]: The opposite of "discretize". There, I've invented a new word for you.

[^5]: Also, but not only due to the fact that the sphincter will have evolved
into an organ capable of perceiving humour, why not.

[^6]: Ever heard of Eccentrica Gallumbits?
