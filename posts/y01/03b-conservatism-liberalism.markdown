In an issue of "The American Spectator" from early 2010, Roger Scruton
presents [an article][spectator] stating the basic values and principles of
both liberalism and conservatism and then attempts to argue the latter's
superiority. While many of the points there are valid, the essay's overall
defense is rather poor, at least given what you'd normally expect from a
well-known philosopher; partly because of various confusions, e.g. between
liberalism in the general sense and social liberalism as a current in the US,
and partly due to the romanticization of the average conservative, which is
unnecessary, if not harmful, given the current political context.

It may be only Scruton, or it may be that Western philosophy has given birth to
a bunch of strawmen that often tend to have little connection with reality. Not
only is political correctness [inherently harmful][political-correctness], but
ideology and politics are themselves (supposedly necessary) evils. Given that
science is necessarily incomplete, and moreover, given that it's very
time-consuming, people need a logical framework in which they can make
decisions efficiently -- read: fast -- in order to solve outstanding problems.
Additionally, given that decisions may turn out to be bad, people need to
assume responsibility and pay for their choices one way or the other.

While this framework supposedly used to work in the past, nowadays it seems
utterly broken. Blame it on the technological disruptions, or blame it on
nowadays' politicians smoking too much weed in the '70s if you will. Blaming
may be easy, but it doesn't change the fact that ideology as a set of sets of
guiding principles doesn't work anymore, and that it needs to be either patched
or completely rethought. It's not that "conservatism" and "liberalism" have
inherent issues, but rather that -isms in general are inherently problematic.

[Socialism][socialism] for example has shifted from solving hard social issues
to a state-driven mechanism for interference in individuals' private
lives. This doctrine works under the faulty basic assumption that adults are
not capable of making their own decisions; or maybe the situation has become
so dire that people are not capable of making individual decisions anymore, so
everyone sees the state as a parent who caters to their prolonged
infancy. This massive emotional retardation is what has ultimately given birth
to Western issues or non-issues such as
["microaggressions", "trigger warnings"][microaggressions], "social justice"
and other such absurd phenomena. In fact the only pressing issue is that
today's 30-year-old (and growing) children are soon going to be given the
reins of power and they'll have absolutely no idea what to do with them,
bringing all of civilization into the
[new age of religiousness][religiousness][^1].

The problems with conservatism and liberalism are strikingly similar. People
who are otherwise well-educated hurry to label themselves as "conservative" or
"liberal", or worse, "libertarian", thinking that this would make any
difference in the world. Meanwhile, there are still basic principles upon
which the world goes round, regardless of what various schools "of thought"
impose upon their followers: for example, most people still have the freedom
to choose what's best for themselves, whether the state considers it's
"moral" or not. Thus most people still have abortions and they still do hard
drugs, and if some of them kill themselves in the process then that's fine,
because it was their choice. This is a universally liberal view of life,
relying not upon the concept of rights as upon [that of freedoms][trilema],
and upon the idea that "your freedom ends where my nose begins". It's your
*right* to choose between this and a boot stamping on a human face, forever.

At the same time, humans have the freedom and the right to defend these basic
freedoms. This includes, but is not limited to [the absolute necessity of
offending people][charlie-hebdo], which states that I have the freedom to say
anything, even things that I don't believe in, as a prerequisite for free
thought and understanding of things. As opposed to "social justice", which will
disappear in at most a generation or two, free thought will still exist as long
as there is [humanity][humanity] in its truest sense, and as long as there are
still humans to perpetuate it. Defending this precious trait of "being human"
therefore denotes a conservative view of life, relying upon the basis that
bases must be relied on, history must be remembered and principles must be
upheld in order to quickly find the tar pits of civilization and avoid them.

It happens, although completely uncoincidentally, that these two views of life
are not mutually exclusive. This only goes to show that everyone is as liberal
to their own well-being as they are conservative to others' attempt to
suppress that well-being. You may of course be aligned with Christians' views
regarding homosexuality or with anarchists' views regarding the state, and
while this may be helpful to your personal affairs, interests and beliefs, it
does not make you more of a "conservative" or "liberal" in the broadest sense
of the words.

Scruton's article is of painful actuality and he is right in arguing against
what he calls the Western "totalitarian sentimentality", essentially a form of
neo-fascism disguised politically as a movement to help oppressed groups. His
words are however embellished with conservatist mumbo-jumbo about family and
morals; and however interesting this may look to the average reader of "The
American Spectator", it contains not even a hint of insight into how the
West's ideological crisis could be resolved. This, I suppose, is left as an
exercise for the reader.

theocratic socialism is Chinese post-communism. Great. Just great.
