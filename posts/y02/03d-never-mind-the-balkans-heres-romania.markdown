On the subject of [the way in which Romanians are][aferim] -- as a matter of
fact, we are talking about the people living in the Carpatho-Danubiano-Pontic
space for the last millenium or so, regardless of their nationality or
ethnicity; however, for the sake of brevity we shall call them Romanians -- it
is worth mentioning that there is a general lack of literature to describe
this, and furthermore there is a lack of people that are both able and willing
to put this on paper[^1].

The fundamental reason behind this is simple. The Romanian language was almost
exclusively a spoken language and very little used in writing until the 19th
century, so most of the documentation on Romanian customs and behaviours is
coming either from the Orthodox Church, mostly in Slavonic, or from Hungarian,
Polish or possibly Austrian and Ottoman sources. Given that most of the
Romanian population was still illiterate until the second half of the 20th
century[^2], only a handful of writers emerged, and to my knowledge at the time
there weren't any notable Romanian writers to tell stories about the Romanian
people from the communist era due to the regime, and there aren't any Romanian
writers to discuss the Romanian people of the post-communist era up to the
present day.

Thus we're left in a rather peculiar situation, where a British guy, Mike
Ormsby, comes to Romania and spends some time here, and then decides to publish
his stories, most of them from the post-2007 Romania[^3], and only a few of
them from the first decade and a half after the (still) confusing turning point
known as December 1989.

Ormsby's book, pompously titled "Never Mind the Balkans, Here's Romania", tells
a bunch of stories about Romania, yet no so much about the country as about the
people living in it and their sorry, happy, tired or lively state. Off the top
of my head, there are very few aspects not covered by the stories, as most of
them can just be found lying in the lines or between them: the agitated
Bucharest; the old and the new city dwellers; the communist block
administrator; the draught and the flu; turbo-folk; pălincă; food, and so on
and so forth. All these details emerge into what most Westerners see as the
template for the very peculiar individual, not quite educated yet not quite
entirely stupid either. The historical reasons behind this are not given, nor
they are even touched upon in the text[^4], yet the substance is there, as a
testament to the fact that a so-called "foreigner" can sometimes understand a
people better than they can understand themselves.

The book's storytelling has a humorous aspect to it. There is an aspect of
comedy even in the bleakest of the stories, which has led Romanian critics to
label Ormsby a "British Ion Luca Caragiale". However, there's no doubt about
the fact that the humour there -- in the English version of the book, at least
-- is typically British in nature, and some of the sarcasm may be lost on the
average Romanian reader, although my impression was that the book was written
to be read by foreigners rather than Romanians.

All in all "Never Mind the Balkans, Here's Romania" is a surprisingly
interesting book, one that you may want to hand over to your children to help
them understand the average Romanian person. It gives a pretty good
description of the country and its people, minus the useless
[dumb nationalism][nationalism]:

> In the wide dusty courtyard below, tough-looking young guys in polyester
> tracksuits lounge around an old Dacia. [...] The vehicle's doors are wide
> open and a powerful sound system is pumping turbo-folk music at a volume
> likely to induce nosebleeds in small children and angina attacks in the
> elderly. The singer on the CD sounds like he jammed his fingers in a
> door. [...] One lad paws at a doe-eyed girl in a tight top and short
> skirt. It looks like a sultry play by Tennessee Williams, with no interval.

[^1]: Notable exceptions are Caragiale, Creangă, Slavici and maybe
Rebreanu. Eminescu can only at most be considered a gatherer of so-called
"Romanian folklore", his main problem being that he lived the 1800s, when
being a national something-or-the-other became fashionable.

[^2]: When the communist rule came and attempted to introduce literacy by
force. The results were interesting, to say the least: although they've
succeeded, Romania's authentic cultural heritage is still mostly rural and
orally communicated. The working hypothesis is that some of the typical
Romanian customs and behaviours are simply impossible to transcribe, much to
ethnologists' disappointment. There are notable exceptions of course, such as
the Merry Cemetery from Săpânța.

[^3]: The year when Romania became a member state of the European Union.

[^4]: Sociologists are doing a [pretty bad job][cosima] of this anyway.
