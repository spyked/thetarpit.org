> result, saying the National Front was "the only party that can
> reconquer the lost territories of the republic, of Calais, where we

> of our way of life."

> in the political debate, not only on the right but also, more and
> more, on the left and in particular in the voice of the executive
> branch, and that legitimizes the National Front," he said.
>
> Both Mr. Hollande and Prime Minister Manuel Valls have evoked more
> nationalistic themes recently and taken a particularly hard line on
> security issues. Although the government is leans left, its leaders
> have begun to discuss extending the state of emergency, which gives
> law enforcement extraordinary powers, beyond its current duration of
> three months.

> had been widely expected to win.
