A couple of years ago I was arguing that
[cloud software is unreliable][part-i], and moreover, that the concept
itself is fundamentally flawed. The ifs and whys of this discussion
were, and probably still are, debatable, but the fact is that despite my
argument, people use the so-called "cloud" a lot more than they've been
using it two years ago. Not only that, but they've come to *rely* on it,
or *depend* on it, if you will; I myself am using it more and more under
social pressure from friends, co-workers and so on, despite the fact
that distributed[^1], albeit less convenient alternatives do exist. So a
rather good question is, how much we're actually trading for that
convenience?

This migration towards service-as-a-stuff is happening despite recent
events such as the Sony PSN hacks, the infamous iCloud scandal, numerous
database leaks from corporations and so on and so forth. These are all
apparently small and forgettable[^2], and I've already foreseen some of
them in [the previous part][part-i]; but since they're not the only
ones, it doesn't hurt to extend the thought experiment with more (more
gruesome, painful and whatnot) scenarios.

**Scenario 4**: The enemy of the state. I've been avoiding this in the
previous scenarios, more for the sake of not giving in to paranoia if
anything. However, it has become clear that today's states, even the
ones in the so-called "[civilized][political-correctness]" Western
world, *especially* those in the Western world, will gladly smash your
head[^3] to ensure their own security. In that moment, the state[^4]
will have complete control over your data, including the power to forge
stuff. Because in the logic of "preventing" "terrorism", no one's really
thought of actually preventing terrorism.

**Scenario 5**: The great bankrupcy. Corporations are people, and
people, believe it or not, very often die of natural causes. So what
will happen with your company's data when they discontinue Google? This
will send giant ripples all through the Interwebs, and while you're
drowning, somewhere on the sides you'll see ol' Richard Stallman chewing
his foot and saying "I told you so".

**Scenario 6**: The Second Library of Alexandria (as coined in
[the archive™][the-archive]). This is pretty much the endgame scenario
for the Internet, the most improbable of all, given the latter's
resilience. However, "resilience" is still billions of miles away from
"immunity", which makes the thought behind this scenario at least
interesting, if not of any practical use. It's safe to say that in such
an improbable event, [your worth to humanity][worth-humanity] will be
much higher if you have control over your very own data.

Or, as the old saying goes, "don't put all your eggs in one basket".

[^1]: Not necessarily the same as "decentralized". For example Bitcoin
is distributed in the sense that storage exists, and control flow
occurs, independently on each node; moreover, it is decentralized in the
sense that updates to the storage are performed by everyone according to
a clearly defined set of validation rules. It is however centralized in
the sense that it depends on a single conceptual data store to be
synchronized between the nodes. That would arguably be considered a
point of failure, if it weren't such a great feature.

[^2]: Although I would argue the opposite. I wouldn't trust my personal
data to entities with a track record of well-known exploited
vulnerabilities. Wait, what do you mean "it's the hackers' fault"? I
don't care if it is, it's *my* personal data.

[^3]: To quote Orwell's 1984:

    > There will be no curiosity, no enjoyment of the process of
    > life. All competing pleasures will be destroyed. But always -- do
    > not forget this, Winston -- always there will be the intoxication
    > of power, constantly increasing and constantly growing
    > subtler. Always, at every moment, there will be the thrill of
    > victory, the sensation of trampling on an enemy who is
    > helpless. If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot
    > stamping on a human face -- forever.

    I don't know about the novel's other predictions, but this one has
    definitely become true. In the name of democracy and all.

[^4]: So that we're clear, "the state" includes "tech companies" such as
Google, Facebook and Amazon. Might as well call them "the department of
ads", "the department of more ads" and "the department of selling you
ads via drones". Hey, whaddaya know, they've come up with a politically
correct word for "propaganda"!
