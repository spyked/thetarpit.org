Society, or rather agents of society who get paid in order to ensure the
continued existence of abstract entities such as "the society", "the
state" and so on and so forth, have taught us individuals that laws have
been put in place by our forefathers for morals, ethics, or in other
words, for normative reasons. This, of all things, ensures that within
the pale of "society", "state" (and so on and so forth) activities ocur
deterministically, and thus the continued existence of said entities.

In modern democratic society, a heavy counterbalance to those otherwise
contemptible pieces of propaganda[^1] is the mechanism of vote. At least
theoretically, people meet, discuss, debate, and decide based on hard
numbers whether a given law is worth applying or not. Also
theoretically, such decisions are taken based primarily on the common
sense and the common good.

However, given that both common-sense and common-good are vaguely
defined terms[^2], in practice laws get validated based on group
interests. When democracy inevitably fails, group interests become the
norm and are introduced systematically either directly through
"lobbying", or using plain old doublespeak à la "pro-life/pro-choice",
"pro/anti global climate change", "animal rights", etc. Thus in the
rather harsh times our dear old Western civilization is going through,
it is safe to assume that laws are not only not based on common-sense
and common-good, but that they may encompass completely opposite
principles.

Thus, for our exercise in independent thought, let us take two disparate
and completely non-interesting examples.

**First example**: Parlamentul a stabilit la cati caini au dreptul
  ciobanii. Legea "3, 2, 1 dulai", criticata de ministrul
  Agriculturii[^3]:

> O lege adoptata de parlamentari schimba regulile de la stana. In
> functie de regiune, ciobanii au voie sa tina la turma unul, doi sau
> trei caini. Daca au mai multi, amenzile ajung pana la 1500 de lei.
>
> Crescatorii de animale sunt revoltati pentru ca, spun ei, nu au cum
> sa-si apere oile de lupi.
>
> [...]
>
> Ioan Moga, crescator de oi: "Cine a mai pomenit asa ceva. Eu de 50 de
> ani cresc oi si mereu am avut cate 6, 7 chiar 8 caini la turma. Sa
> raman cu 2? Ce fac? Au veni lupii chiar aici si mi-au atacat oile. O
> sa vina sa ne dea si amenzi din alea mari."

Or, in plain English. [Romanian] Parliament regulates the number of dogs
to which shepherds are entitled. The law "3, 2, 1 hounds", criticized by
the minister of Agriculture:

> A law passed by congressmen changes sheepfold rules. Depending on the
> region, shepherds may keep one, two or three dogs to guard their
> flock. Those who keep more will receive fines up to 1500 lei.
>
> Animal breeders are revolted because they claim that they are now
> unable to defend their sheep from wolves.
>
> [...]
>
> Ioan Moga, dog breeder: "This is unheard of. For 50 years I've been
> raising sheep and I always had 6, 7 or even 8 dogs near the herd. To
> be left with 2? What am I going to do? Wolves came right here and they
> attacked my sheep. They're going to come and give us those big fines."

In short, the example above is a case of not one, but two mistakes that
no lawmaker should ever commit[^4].

The first mistake is the choice of "three, two, one, depending on the
region". This number looks, and most probably is completely
arbitrary. Why three dogs and not four? Why not two big ones and a
smaller one? Why not twenty chihuahuas, for that matter? Educated
persons know that universal constants are mere exceptions, and even
those are baffling to the extreme.

The second mistake is that the law fails to address the root causes of
the whole scandal, i.e. that dogs are aggressive, that they kill wild
animals and attack tourists. Up next, women won't be allowed to have
more than two babies in a period of ten years, due to the pollution
caused by baby feces; citizens will not be allowed to breathe more than
three liters of air per day, to lower the quantity of CO2 emitted by
humans. There's more but I'm gonna stop here, I'm probably giving these
nutters ideas.

**Second example**:
  [La gare de Renens évacuée à cause d'un colis suspect][renens]:

> La gare de Renens (VD) a été évacuée jeudi à 19 heures après la
> découverte d'une valise abandonnée. A Genève, un sac de sport a été
> neutralisé vers 20 heures à Rive.
>
> [...]
>
> A Renens, une autre intervention a eu lieu. Celle du Groupe de
> spécialistes en dépiégeage (GSD). Elle a pris fin à 21 heures. Aucun
> objet dangereux n'a finalement été découvert dans la valise. Celle-ci
> ne contenait que des effets personnels, selon un communiqué de la
> police.

Or, in short[^5], people in the small municipality of Renens, Vaud,
Switzerland, get all fussy over a luggage left in the train station[^6],
by someone who has most probably forgotten it there, the poor fool.

Now, the way things go in civilized countries such as Switzerland,
someone needs to pay for all this fuss[^7]. Given the incident, both
executive and judiciary organs will have to establish how the incident
took place, why it took place, and why did citizen Y leave his luggage
in the train station in the first place?

On the other hand, if the average educated person were to look at the
whole thing from a sane, pre-9/11 perspective, they would be completely
confused, firstly by the authorities' reaction, and secondly by everyone
else's complete fear and submission to this whole situation. What do you
mean, we have to look at the context? Have the laws changed so awfully
radically because of [Charlie Hebdo][charlie-hebdo]? Are today's more
"civilized people" more quick to "pray for Paris" than to take a moment
to think about the whole situation[^8]?

So, now that a few idiots finally learned how to make bombs out of
household items, people can lose their jobs for spitting, and they can
get fined over leaving a bag in the train station. Up next, policemen
will arrest another poor fool, unable to determine exactly why. I
wonder, what would have Kafka thought about this?

It seems that laws don't work anymore. Well. At least
marketing still does... [or does it][marketing-failure]?

[^1]: Propaganda, education, not much of a difference there. They're
both for the feeble-minded, both serving the purpose of training
monkeys, with the notable distinction that the former strives to keep
adults in their sorry state, while the latter enforces norms in order to
open up horizons towards humanity. Regardless, they're both useful tools
for whomever wields them.

[^2]: The problem with applying "common good" on the other is that you
don't do what the other *wants*, but what *is good for them*. So despite
what the strangely cognitively dissonant "generation X" would have you
believe (they're seriously insane anyway, really!), this may or may not
include beating the hell out of the other. In fact, one of the few
things in life that can never ever, ever, ever be avoided is pain of all
kinds.

    The problem with "common sense" is that it's subject to cultural
    relativism -- see the cognitive dissonance of the previously
    mentioned "generation X". Remember that back in the day some
    cultures held in high regards the belief that eating people is
    ok. Sure, you might think that this can never ever happen in your
    culture, because your culture is superior. Well, no, it's not; in
    fact "pop culture" is in our times the standard example of an
    inferior culture. First and foremost in the light of the fact that
    it will not stand the test of time.

[^3]: The original story can be found on the
[ProTV news site][first-example] (warning, it's very JavaScript and
Flash-heavy).

[^4]: And for which those Romanian guys should be beaten with a short,
sharp stick, just like in the old times. Yes, it's uncivilized. Yes, the
guys deserve it. They essentially ate their taxpayers' money with this
shit, and now-democratic Romanians [stand this][balkans] the way they've
stood it during communism, [Ottoman rule][aferim], and probably during
the Dacian times too, since they're so very
[proud of it][nationalism]. The way things look, they're going to accept
this state of affairs for the foreseeable future, and the Western world
will end up finding a model in that, or something.

[^5]: For plain English translations, hire someone. Or, y'know, get a
book, learn some French, it's not a dead language yet.

[^6]: It's amusing how the original article fails to give any useful
information about the somewhat similar event in Geneva, probably because
they weren't given any hints by the authorities, and probably because
that one was a serious incident. In this case, presspeople just apply
the classic trick of misdirection, despite the fact that the event in
Geneva was most likely more serious and the public is worried and all
that. Journalism, Iknowrite?

[^7]: They had to evacuate a whole train station, mobilize bomb
specialists, all that mumbo-jumbo. That stuff costs, and yes, someone
oughta be held responsible and pay for it. I mean, it's not that "it
just happened", right?

[^8]: Masses' traditional lack of rationality is exactly why people
"voted for" Lenin, Hitler and Le Pen a while after choosing those other
guys. You know the ones that history scarcely remembers.
