title: Academic hogwash: an empirical study thereof
excerpt: In which we analyze the circular motivations behind academic publishing. Probably a rehash of some other essay, but it's ok to do it nowadays.

Scientia[^1] is brain-wreckingly difficult. What with it being a field
where people work their asses off to push the boundaries of what we
know and discover what we don't know and other tar pits.

Since the intellectual demands of said jobs are so high, it's not enough
to push and discover and so on and so forth. New conceptual horizons are
muddy, so at least half of the job, if not ninety-nine percent of it,
involves making them clear, preferably in a language that "the
scientific community" will easily comprehend[^2]. If you've any doubts
about that, you may study the historical examples of Einstein, Bohr,
Pauli and others[^3].

Traditionally, the average "man of knowledge"[^4] does this by sitting
on his ass somewhere, taking a piece of paper and jotting some ideas
off, then re-writing them two or ten or a hundred times, in any case,
until they are refined enough to be presented in front of said
"scientific community". Once that is done, other "men of knowledge"[^5]
will spend some of their precious time reviewing the work and deciding
whether it is worth presenting to the world at large as a fact. Simple,
right?

The reader will have to excuse me, for I am only a budding youngster on
this matter, so I don't know the specific historical events that led to
the current state of affairs, but I can make a pretty good guess that
the point where everything turned upside down was when someone started
talking about some nonsense or other, which they decided to call
"academic standards"[^6].

So, to better illustrate the main point, back in the day getting a PhD
would involve coming up with a model of relativity, or discovering DNA,
or reasoning about abstract shit such as computation. In contrast,
getting a PhD nowadays involves "publishing X papers to Y journals and Z
conferences rated by Alpha company"[^7]. Because if everything else
becomes an industry, then so must science. Quite convenient, isn't it?

And thusly nowadays the end goal of youngsters fiddling with Scientia
isn't to push the boundaries of knowledge anymore. Since "objective
evaluation"[^8] is now a thing, it's enough for them to attempt to meet
that criteria. That is all, and everyone's happy, right?

Not really. Now Alpha company will label journal Y and conference Z as
more-or-less "prestigious", so dumbsters[^9] will pay to get more stuff
published. Y and Z will only struggle to attract even more materials
through the so-called "CFPs", in order to keep rejection rates up and
thus be themselves rated "objectively" by Alpha as
"prestigious". Meanwhile, dumbsters will jump with joy that one of their
papers containing this or that -- at this point it's not like anyone
cares about the actual content anymore -- has been published to
"prestigious Y"[^10] and they're one more step toward graduation,
tenure, or whatever else is fashionable in the academia
nowadays[^11]. Lo and behold, intellectual production has exceeded 200%
this quinquennium[^12], all praise multilaterally-developed science!

So, [what shall we do now][pink-floyd]? Well, one good idea would be to
punch an academic in the face[^13].

Oh, you meant, doing that in a
[politically correct][political-correctness] way? No, I'm afraid there
isn't much to be done, welcome to the new, glorious age of
[post-religion][post-religion].

[^1]: That is, the female personification of knowledge, whom everyone
seems to want to rape nowadays.

    So, you've just started reading this and there I go, not even
    bothering to leave the reader to get acquainted with the article's
    tone and such. What, you really thought this was going to be an
    academic essay? Go read your abstracts somewhere else, this isn't an
    awful FSM-damned "prestigious journal".

[^2]: Where "language" doesn't necessarily mean English. Oh, I mean,
sure, everyone speaks it nowadays, but make the simple exercise of
looking at the frequency of most terms in the average academic paper
nowadays. In circles where Scientia actually matters, language is much
more subtle a thing than just taking a basic grammar along with some
[marketspeak][marketing] and shuffling them around; it most of all
involves being precise, and this precision cannot be achieved merely by
speaking "English".

[^3]: Ever wonder why most of them are from mathematics and/or physics?
One could argue that they're actually from philosophy, but the fact is,
if I'm not mistaken social sciences and humanities have yet to rock the
world in this fashion. And I doubt they ever will, I doubt it very much.

[^4]: As opposed to just "man of science".

[^5]: Women of knowledge too, we're not trying to be sexist here.

[^6]: Sciences are not the only fields affected by this. Just look at
[the media][media]; and look at all these sites claiming to have "unique
visitors", "apps" claiming to have "millions of downloads", companies
claiming to be valued at billions of dollars. Oh, and they do, they
have, they are, but only insane people would believe that these
so-called "metrics" would have any meaningful
interpretation. Unfortunately some people are way beyond insane
nowadays.

[^7]: Seriously now, who the fuck are Thomson Reuters to decide on
scientific relevance? Since when is the Australian Research Council more
important than, say, common sense? Or has appeal to authority subtly but
suddenly stopped being a logical fallacy in the last few decades? What
do you mean, "we need institutions to"? Who says we do? I for one most
certainly don't want my brain replaced by any "institution", thank you.

[^8]: "Evaluating performance" of human knowledge is pretty much one of
the hardest problems of humanity. That is, in case you're wondering why
[the educational system has failed miserably][grade-inflation]. Also, if
you're wondering which piece on the Internet this essay is rehashing,
it's probably TLP's.

[^9]: In the age of Internet and self-publishing and whatnot, how many
scientists do you know who actually promote sane publishing in favour of
feeding the machine? The only example in my mind is
[Bernstein's IEEE boycott][ieee], otherwise everyone's sucking it
up. Because "we need institutions to", right? Well, joke's on you for
getting involved with the mafiosos.

[^10]: Fine, we can give names. Take for example an article published in
    Nature,
    "[The significant association of Taq1A genotypes in DRD2/ANKK1 with smoking cessation in a large-scale meta-analysis of Caucasian populations][nature]",
    subsequently pop-scientized (by Nature themselves!) in various
    journalistic venues under sensationalistic titles. The paper is bad
    or at most completely irrelevant by sane scientific standards, yet
    it was published in a so-called prestigious journal, therefore it
    must be good!

[^11]: In case you're wondering: yes, I am in the academia at the moment
of writing, and yes, I'm as guilty as all the other people taking, or
worse, promoting this. If you're "one of my peers" and you're dismissing
this with a hand wave, then again, joke's on you, don't say I didn't
tell you. On the other hand, if you're offended, then good, you should
be. Now read this again, and again and again and again until the offense
rubs off on you and *maybe* you'll start thinking, like the intellectual
you are.

[^12]: Harder to get if you didn't live through communism.

[^13]: What do you mean, how to do that, are you a grown up or what?
Fine, here's a decent example from [Rogaway][rogaway].
