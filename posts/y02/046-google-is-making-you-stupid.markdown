title: Ok, I was wrong, it seems that Google is indeed "making you stupid"

Back in Cretaceous while I was still publishing my thoughts on the old
blog, I participated in a very interesting debate with people of the
so-called "Romanian blogosphere" of those times[^1]. The discussion was
on the influence of the Internet on the various real and/or perceived
properties of [human thought][ganditul].

More precisely, some guy had previously published in The Atlantic an
essay entitled "[Is Google Making Us Stupid?][atlantic]", to which I
hastily, in my sheer naïveté, responded that no, it couldn't be such,
since some of us still enjoy that otherwise unfashionable activity of
deep reading; and moreover, that this isn't a problem worthy of focusing
on, since civilization will adapt as it has in the past and so on and so
forth.

In retrospect, the reader must agree with the premise that the question
posed by the initial article denotes idiocy on the author's part. I
don't remember whether this was the case at the time, but "Is X verb Y?"
is a memetic Newspeak-ism that deliberately obfuscates meaning. What
does "making" mean? who is "us"? what does "stupid" mean? and so on and
so forth. What qualia does the article propose to scrutinize? Of course,
it's easy to quote personal experiences, anecdotes and so-called
studies, and to reason upon them. What's considerably more difficult is
being rigorous about the whole bullshit, at the risk of offending
others. Pertinent sociological studies may or may not have been done in
the meantime, you are welcome to point them out to me if you see
fit. Meanwhile, let us take a different approach to deconstructing the
problem.

Google is a wonderful tool, as are the Web and the Internet[^2]. There
was essentially nothing before the Internet, and very little before the
Web[^3]. While Google (the search engine) is a great piece of software,
it's far from being the first of its kind, which means that the
necessity of being able to find things in the vast stuff of the Web[^4]
was there not in 1998, not even in 1995, but from the very beginning of
things. Thus denying the usefuleness of, and moreover, the need for
Google as a tool for finding information on the Internet would be like
denying the need for a hammer to drive nails or the need for a gun to
shoot down your enemy[^5].

However, Google has, like many things have since that day in 2001 when
the world ended for a brief moment, gone through many sets of
transformations. At some point -- I cannot tell exactly when, and again,
maybe here the perspicacious reader might have the patience to enlighten
me -- it became a tool that was separated from its purpose, or, to put
it more bluntly, it became a victim of [marketing][marketing], not
unlike Facebook[^6] and many others which we won't recollect here due to
space constraints.

So yes, breaking news! your environment is shaping the way you think in
both subtle and obvious ways. In his essay, Carr gives us Nietzsche's
example,

>  "You are right," Nietzsche replied, "our writing equipment takes part
>  in the forming of our thoughts." Under the sway of the machine,
>  writes the German media scholar Friedrich A. Kittler, Nietzsche’s
>  prose 'changed from arguments to aphorisms, from thoughts to puns,
>  from rhetoric to telegram style.'

but he deliberately ignores the initial conditions that he himself
has observed:

> Sometime in 1882, Friedrich Nietzsche bought a typewriter—a
> Malling-Hansen Writing Ball, to be precise. His vision was failing,
> and keeping his eyes focused on a page had become exhausting and
> painful, often bringing on crushing headaches. He had been forced to
> curtail his writing, and he feared that he would soon have to give it
> up. The typewriter rescued him, at least for a time. Once he had
> mastered touch-typing, he was able to write with his eyes closed,
> using only the tips of his fingers. Words could once again flow from
> his mind to the page.

Kittler's observation is an interesting one, to say the least. However,
stating that the author's writing was shaped by the typewriter is no
more and no less valid than stating that it was largely influenced by
his failing eyesight or his age. For all we know, it probably was a mix
of these conditions -- and indeed, of many others -- that led to his
telegraphic writing.

So yes, I was wrong, Google "is making you[^7] stupid" if[^8] you've
accustomed yourself to viewing the world through the narrow screen of an
Android phone, subjecting yourself to the random information its
so-called "timeline"[^9] is feeding you, going through regurgitated
"targeted" and "tailored" "news" or whatever it is that you're
consuming. It is indeed turning you into a "pancake", or worse yet, into
an amorphous mass of goo ready to be shaped into a mold, by constantly
asking for your attention through endless "notifications" that you'll
never bother to disable, for the sake of "user experience". For all I
know, Google's already achieved its purpose, so now what?

While I admire Carr's conservativeness and his asking of questions
almost eight years ago, I can only laugh at his own naïveté:

> Never has a communications system played so many roles in our lives --
> or exerted such broad influence over our thoughts -- as the Internet
> does today. Yet, for all that’s been written about the Net, there's
> been little consideration of how, exactly, it's reprogramming us. The
> Net's intellectual ethic remains obscure.

On the contrary, I think there's been much consideration. Google's
machine learning algorithms have reduced your intellect to a statistical
model. That is all you are now, and even if you think more of yourself,
that doesn't matter to Google, and no one will ever see why it
would. "Like", "share", "unique viewers" and "returns" are all that
matter.

What's more baffling is the fact that, for all the debates it has
stirred all over the web these past few years, Nicholas Carr's essay
remains a brief historical "I told you so" note and not much else. This
is -- quite ironically, come to think of it -- an illustration of the
fact that "awareness" doesn't work when it involves actual
thinking. Meanwhile, more irony at eleven o'clock: The Atlantic fucks
its readers over with shitty ads and civilization continues to fail.

[^1]: This is in a purely coincidental manner related to this post's
    subject. A generation ago "those times" used to mean "a generation
    ago", while now "those times" means "five or six years ago". Of
    course, the idea of whether "a lot of time" actually passed between
    then and now is still up for debate.

[^2]: I assume that the astute reader is able to distinguish and
    discriminate between the three. Otherwise, there's the door.

[^3]: People of "the previous generation" might remember Gopher, Usenet
    and so on. I wasn't there, but it would make a lot of sense to
    compare these to nowadays' technologies, which would give some
    historical perspective on the latter's *actual* usefuleness.

[^4]: But not -- and this is a very important point -- on the
    Internet. Although CERN's version of hypertext appeared while the
    Internet was still largely an experimental thing, the two developed
    independently. That is, there is a vast amount of stuff in the even
    vaster amount of stuff that is the Internet that you won't find
    using Google. Ever.

[^5]: Feel free to replace "Google" with an equally stupid name that you
    and your friends use.

[^6]: Facebook has a very similar history to Google's. It wasn't the
    first social networking site, maybe not even the greatest, but it
    became "the norm" in this field.

    They're also very similar in that they're both serving the same
    purpose nowadays, which is serving ads, more so that Google is
    desperately trying to become the Social Network, while Facebook is
    desperately trying to become the Search Engine. Funny how these
    things go, right?

[^7]: Not "us". Never *us*.

[^8]: This is a very big "if". As a matter of fact, Diana was spot-on on
    [her initial point][diana] that Google merely gives you the
    opportunity to dumben yourself. Fortunately for us sane people, this
    doesn't make it any less useful of a search engine.

[^9]: Or "stream". Same shit, really.
