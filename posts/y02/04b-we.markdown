Yevgeny Zamyatin's novel is a classical depiction of the socialist lamb
of the socialist God living the socialist utopia, subject to the whims
of a socialist Church like any other[^1].

The story's brilliance derives primarily from the fact that it is built
as a first-person (and thus inherently subjective) narration of its main
character, D-503, a so-called Number of
[the machine][mechanics-of-socialism] called the United State and a cog
in said machine, writing his, or rather its journal to be spread
throughout the entire universe to explain to other curious beings how
this great machine works. In a twist of irony, the story somehow ended
up being transported back in time to 20th (and now 21st) century Earth,
where, or rather when we can amuse ourselves of the sheer stupidity of
the socialist individual[^2].

The number D-503 -- like most other numbers, the reader is left to
assume -- is not merely proud to be part of the United State; more than
that, it can not conceive of anything other than the United State as it
is during its time. In the number's own words, the United State is like
a Platonic geometrical shape, symmetrical and uniform, and anything
other than that is considered to be less-than-perfect according to State
rules and regulations.

State rules and regulations are axiomatic "mathematical" facts, and they
regulate pretty much everything, starting from the time numbers wake up,
go to sleep and have sex, to the daily work they do and the propaganda
they are to be subjected to. Naturally, at least from the point of view
of the average comrade, numbers are not supposed to think by themselves,
feelings being frowned upon and fancy being considered absolute
heresy. In other words, Saint Taylor decreed that independent thought is
unscientific (and thus harmful), the hair left on one's hands is an
imperfection inherited from a long-lost race of prehistoric animals, and
thus being anything but a piece of mindless, soulless matter is
unscientific, State above all. Now, this sounds bleak when you look at
it from outside, but the way the main character describes everything is
meant only to denote numbers' infantile mis-thought. Thus the situation
looks absolutely hilarious, a feature which we may attribute to
Zamyatin's own Russian dark humour.

Not unlike other dystopian novels[^3], We's plot is feminine in
nature. Some chick attempting to start a revolution uses this particular
tool-with-a-cock-attached to wreak some havoc. Again, this is
unremarkable. What is however out of the ordinary is D-503's discovery
that there is civilization outside the United State and that there
exists a freedom other than the doublespoken spoken notion thereof,
inoculated in all numbers' feeble minds by the propaganda machine.

The reader is thus presented with a gradual, yet still subjective story
of D-503's evolution from a mere number to a human being with a
soul. Too little, too late, as they say. At the end of it all, the
unbearably stupid number is still unable to grasp the idea that there
might be other "We"s than the United State, or, indeed, any other "We"s
at all[^4]. And so the main character's soul is swiftly removed by the
Well-Doer's machine and all comes back to the status quo, as things
usually go in comedies.

The only implausible aspect in Zamyatin's dystopia, as in Orwell's, as
in Huxley's, is the perennity of such dreadful machines. But we can
forgive We by also labeling it as a Science Fiction slash Fantasy work,
where engineering has achieved something other than
[a complete breakdown][myth-software-engineering] and where
[marketing, that is, propaganda][marketing] works forever and ever.

[^1]: Regardless of whether you call it the Catholic Church, Soviet
    Union or post-9/11 United States.

    Sure, to the untrained eye the US are "the most capitalist state",
    "the best goddamned country" and whatnot. The untrained eye however
    fails to observe that just because KFC tastes like chicken and
    "they" tell you it has at least 20% chicken, that by itself does not
    make it chicken. This sort of charlatanism is uncoincidentally the
    prime mark of the so-called "socialist utopia".

[^2]: NB, there is no such thing as a socialist individual, the term is
    pure contradiction. The so-called "socialist individual" is but a
    bunch of mindless, soulless matter whose purpose is solely to be
    used by the machine. This is another aspect that is masterfully
    illustrated by the novel.

[^3]: Although to be completely honest, it was Orwell who was inspired
    by We and not the other way around.

[^4]: This is a lesson on the irreversible retardation of socialist
    thinking. What, there are people who don't eat the same bullshit as
    you? Who could have ever thought that?!
