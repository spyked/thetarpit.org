Let's begin with a selective [quote from Moldbug][moldbug]:

The snippets above discuss Freedom is Slavery in the context of Western
politics, i.e. whatever meddling shit Americans and their allies[^1]
have been undertaking in Iraq, Egypt, Syria, etc. in the last few
decades or so. That's all nice and good.

What Moldbug misses is that this aspect of people wilfully becoming
slaves of various stuff, most of all to their own stupidity, is becoming
entrenched in today's Western culture. Orwell might have gotten it
right, but then again, he might have meant something else completely, so
let's discuss that too.

So what does Freedom is Slavery mean? According to the definition of
doublethink, the slogan is to be interpreted as freedom -- as
interpreted by the average citizen -- not being actual freedom, but the
exact opposite, which is... slavery, right? Well, right, only not
quite. Orwell might have described it this way for the sake of
satirizing some aspects of Soviet communism, but I'm not entirely sure
that freedom means what he thought it does or that slavery is even a
conceptual opposite. There's been a lot of discussion going on about the
meaning of freedom for more than a century now, so I'm not going to go
into the depths of all that; but I do want to make sure we're not making
basic mistakes such as confusing freedom and right[^2].

Simply put, freedom can be considered the absence of constraints, as per
the definition in Merriam-Webster. This may in some sense be equivalent
to being freed of physical shackles, e.g. when being freed from prison,
but *not necessarily*[^3], and this "not necessarily" is what's
important to us. Freedom is a state of affairs as much as it is a state
of mind[^4] and one cannot go without the other.

Additionally, freedom, or at least a doublespoken version of it, also
denotes giving things away without asking for anything in return,
i.e. "for free", as gratuity, etc. This meaning is also of interest to
us, since it is one of the biggest pitfalls used to create slavery in
nowadays' Western society.

Slavery on the other hand is in its old Aritstotelian sense not
necessarily the absence of freedom as it is the presence of
dependence. That is, despite what the socialist pigs might have the
naïve believe, the condition of being a slave necessarily flows not only
from the freedom of becoming one, but also from the slave's acceptance
as well as the owner's will. So Moldbug's argument holds because he
knows that freeing the average derp is not in and of itself enough, as
the derp in question will have absolutely no idea what to do with said
freedom and will thus fall back to his natural slave-state.

In other words, there is no such thing as "giving [someone] freedom",
which follows directly from freedom being a state of mind.

So, putting the above together, we may say that slavery is, possibly
among other things, the freedom of being subject to another. Assuming
even that one is born a slave, then slavery is the freedom to not do
anything in order to not be a slave, which is what puts some sort of
approximate equivalence sign between this and the welfare state.

So, freedom, or rather free-dom -- that is, things that are for free do
bear a cost, like any other thing in the observable physical
Universe. The cost is that of creating a relationship in which the taker
becomes dependent on the giver-away, which is also why the first dose is
always free. In other words, Freedom is Slavery. There you go.

Now that we're here, let us give a few examples of Freedom is Slavery in
the so-called modern Western culture.

Example the first, and my
favourite. [Da muthafuckin' cloud][cloud-software]. No, all that stuff
isn't for free. The trick is for you to put all your stuff on their
servers instead of buying (cheap) storage for yourself, and then for
them to fuck you in the ass however they want with
"[I have altered the deal][deal-worse]" moments. And by the time you
figure it out, switching to alternatives is much too costly to even be
considered.

Example the second, and my other favourite. Software Freedom. While
monsieur Stallman was no nitwit, he was pretty naïve himself by
believing that people will actually read the code -- spoiler: no,
[they will not][software-engineering-ii]. Using software will almost
always make one dependent on it, whether in terms of how the data is
represented or what the algorithm does, etc. Now, while using
proprietary software will make you dependent on companies such as
Microsoft, Google or Apple, using free software makes you dependent on
the nerd who's writing the goddamn code -- *unless* you read the code
and learn to maintain it yourself, and this is quite a big
unless. That's why licenses that provide the software "as-is" are the
most honest of them all; they just give you the chance to fuck yourself
in the ass.

Example the third. Fiat money. Classical example of a corporation
offering you a good deal in social security if you let it print however
much money it wants. Except it's a really bad deal, in that you're not
gonna see any of those money.

Example the fourth, fifth, up to the nth. Basically any contract or
agreement in which you have no say other than "I Accept"[^5].

And that about sums up Freedom is Slavery.

[^1]: Their enemies too, because why not.

[^2]: Just to get that out of the way: you have a freedom when you can
    do stuff, while you have a right when some controlling entity such
    as the State allows you to do stuff. So for example [We][we] tells
    the story of a place where people have no freedoms, but they do have
    certain rights, such as the right to eat, which incidentally is also
    an obligation established in great detail, e.g. by the amount of
    times one must chew their food before swallowing it.

    So in the sense of hierarchy of power, which is exactly what Moldbug
    discusses in his essay and what we are discussing in this one,
    freedom is the set of things that fall out of the state's
    control. This is why for example you are not granted the right to
    death, but you certainly have the freedom to do so, and nobody but
    your God can and may punish you for it.

[^3]: Just ask Brooks Hatlen:

    > **Dufresne**: I just don't understand what happened in there.
    >
    > **Heywood**: Old man's crazy as a rat in a tin shithouse, is what.
    >
    > **Red**: Oh Heywood, that's enough out of you!
    >
    > **Ernie**: I heard he had you shittin' in your pants!
    >
    > **Heywood**: Fuck you!
    >
    > **Red**: Would you knock it off? Brooks ain't no bug. He's
    > just... just institutionalized.
    >
    > **Heywood**: Institutionalized, my ass.
    >
    > **Red**: The man's been in here fifty years, Heywood. Fifty years!
    > This is all he knows. In here, he's an important man. He's an
    > educated man. Outside, he's nothin'! Just a used up con with
    > arthritis in both hands.

[^4]: Which is why in nature there is no excuse for stupidity, and why
    ultimately [the former abhors equality][slither-io].

[^5]: See for example Popescu's
    [Here's what they don't tell you when they bring you those papers to sign][trilema].
