Nationalism, especially of the [utterly retarded][dumb-nationalism]
type, is a dying faith[^1]. It may have been born out of legitimate
causes and may even have addressed some legitimate issues at its time,
but as much as it may upset some historians, the fact is that it was
only a fad. However, unlike the typical fad that lasts a generation or
two at most, this one somehow managed to seemingly outlive its fad
status by remaining in the collective memory for almost two
centuries. One may hypothesize that most of its existence was due to
pure inertia, but truth be told, we don't know; nationalism seems alive
for now, but it smells funny.

Given this rather bleak context, Romania's National-fad Liberal-fad
Party-fad[^2] entered this summer's race for local elections with a
rather shitty paraphrase of the country's national anthem as a
slogan. This, plus the fact that Romanian parliamentary elections are
nigh and that Romania's national day is even nearer, gives us the
opportunity to (re)read, (re)analyze and give a hopefully accurate[^3]
translation of said anthem for those who don't understand the
language. So without further ado, let us proceed:

> *Awaken thee[^4], O Romanian, from that slumber of death,*  
> (Deșteaptă-te, române, din somnul cel de moarte,)  
> *Into which have buried you the barbaric tyrants*  
> (În care te-adânciră barbarii de tirani)  
> *Now or never make for thyself[^5] another fate,*  
> (Acum ori niciodată croiește-ți altă soarte,)  
> *To which shall bow even your cruel foes.*  
> (La care să se-nchine și cruzii tăi dușmani.)
>
> *Now or never let us give proof to the world[^6]*  
> (Acum ori niciodată să dăm dovezi la lume)  
> *That through these hands still courses a Roman[^7] blood,*  
> (Că-n aste mâini mai curge un sânge de roman,)  
> *And that in our chests we preserve with pride a name*  
> (Și că-n a noastre piepturi păstrăm cu fală-un nume)  
> *Triumphant in battles, a name of Trajan[^8].*  
> (Triumfător în lupte, un nume de Traian.)
>
> *Behold, great shadows[^9], Mihai[^10], Ștefan[^11], Corvinus[^12],*  
> (Priviți, mărețe umbre, Mihai, Ștefan, Corvine,)  
> *The Romanian nation, your great-grandchildren[^13],*  
> (Româna națiune, ai voștri strănepoți,)  
> *With their arms armed[^14], with your fire in their veins,*  
> (Cu brațele armate, cu focul vostru-n vine,)  
> *"Life in freedom or death"[^15] all shout.*  
> ("Viața-n libertate ori moarte" strigă toți.)
>
> *Priests, lead with your crosses for the host is Christian[^16],*  
> (Preoți, cu crucea-n frunte căci oastea e creștină,)  
> *The slogan is liberty and its purpose all-holy.*  
> (Deviza-i libertate și scopul ei preasfânt.)  
> *We better die in battle, in wholesome glory,*  
> (Murim mai bine-n luptă, cu glorie deplină,)  
> *Than being slaves again upon our ancient land.*  
> (Decât să fim sclavi iarăși în vechiul nost' pământ.)

I skipped a few verses, but that's mostly it. Now, let's state a few
simple facts about 2016's Romania in relation to Andrei Mureșanu's poem.

One. Romanian speakers in Maramureș are very different people from the
ones in Olt; not necessarily ethnically and not necessarily in the
language they speak, but in the way they freely govern themselves.

Two. Urban Romania, especially the one from Bucharest, and rural Romania
are essentially two different countries. We leave aside details such as
the fact that a big part of the so-called cities are in fact villages in
disguise[^17], we lean on the fact that city dwellers are increasingly
alienated from villagers.

Three. A significant part of Romanians are functionally illiterate (and
numbers are growing, I might add), and quite a few of them are
completely illiterate (and probably growing). The National Liberal
Party, like any other party in Romania, is currently unable to handle
this issue.

Four. These aspects considered, a fall back to an agrarian society might
not be such a bad outcome. Sadly, an evolution to a post-Romanian
society might be inevitable.

So if there was an awakening, I must have missed it.

[^1]: While some of the alarmist media outlets would have you believe
    the exact opposite, you'll be wondering yourself: how come
    nationalism is dying?

    Well, there was a time when people used to learn the principles upon
    which their nation was built. Knowing their national anthem wasn't
    an option, uttering it daily was quite a common thing, while
    studying the struggle of the people who founded the nation was an
    obligatory step towards education -- that is,
    [being human][humanity].

    Well, no more! Nowadays' kids are entitled, they are empowered, they
    are the future. They have rights, they have smartphones, so who the
    fuck is supposed to educate them anymore.

    In other words, the cultural fundament of nation-states is eroding,
    and with immigrants coming to a city near you it's eroding *fast*;
    and one day it's going to crack; not today, not tomorrow, maybe not
    even the day after that, but *one day* it will, and you might be
    unlucky enough to live to be part of the show; and if not, then your
    children will be. And no so-called nationalist party will be able to
    stop that.

[^2]: National-fad because, as we mentioned, the dumb nationalism
    promoted by the so-called party is a fad. Looking at Romanians'
    trust in politicians, we can firmly state that 2016's older (born
    and raised communist) people are disappointed, while a large portion
    of the 25-something-to-35 citizens are highly skeptical that
    anything good can come out of "Romania". For all we know and care,
    the regions inside the Carpathian arc would after all these decades
    be better off separated from the pile of shit that is Bucharest's
    central "leadership".

    Liberal-fad because [liberalism][liberalism-conservatism] is going
    through its own death for one, and on the other hand because today's
    Romanian liberalism has nothing to do with (the now traditional, go
    figure!) pre and interbellum liberalism.

    Party-fad because Romania has started* the trend that's now followed
    by the entire Western "politics", namely that of utter idiocracy.

    \-\-\-  
    \* Or has it, now? at least the Western politics of the late '80s
      seemed more or less sane looking from this part of the world,
      although I'd guess they only seemed that way. From many points of
      view that's when it also started going into a rot, given that this
      is when the sexually liberated pot consumers of the '60s were
      starting to gain power.

[^3]: Semantically rather than poetically. For the record, this is a
    very good exercise in understanding both languages. Who knows, I may
    even revisit it from time to time to remake it and/or polish it.

[^4]: The awakening mentioned in the text is supposed to evoke the image
    of opening eyes. So the persona is impelling the reader to take a
    good look around them and in the mirror, and to *realize* what's
    going on.

    While I admit that it's a very good nationalist message, this is
    also quite ironically what Romanians haven't been doing for the
    last, oh, half a century or more. Is it because the anthem's song
    sounds so fuckin' depressing? I have no idea.

[^5]: Literally "tailor for thyself", which has the connotation of
    taking one's destiny into their own hands.

    This is entirely different from *choosing* another fate for
    oneself, which is how we figure out that the so-called NLP's slogan
    is only targeted at mediocre sheeple.

[^6]: Romanian speakers of those times were as far as I can tell eager
    to show the world their to-be nationality, more so that the
    Transylvania that was then part of the decaying Austrian Empire
    harbored establishment-hating "revolutionaries" such as the poem's
    author.

    Or maybe not so much establishment-hating as desperately in need to
    be recognized. I guess history is pretty vague here?

[^7]: Romanian speakers of those times were also keen to emphasize that
    the so-called Romanians are rightful descendants of Rome ("De la Rîm
    ne tragem"), despite the fact that there was no real mention of
    "Romania" before then.

    Although they did make a very valid point stating the fact that the
    language's preservation, or at least its grammar's preservation --
    including in Transylvania -- is somewhat mysterious. Genetically
    speaking Romanians aren't Romans more than they are Slavs or Cumans
    or Pechenegs, not unlike other peoples in the geographical
    area. Even so, the Latin spoken in said area was and is *the* vulgar
    Latin, closely related to Sardinian and to some degree with Romansh.

[^8]: Y'know, the guy who brought back home to Rome a darn good amount
    of his times' [bitcoins][bitcoin] after kicking Decebalus' ass.

[^9]: I.e. ghosts of the past, inextricably tied to the nation's present
    state of affairs, etc.

[^10]: Michael the Brave, first leader to rule Wallachia, Moldavia and
    Ardeal simultaneously, for a very brief while before his murder.

[^11]: Stephen the Great, longest-living ruler of a Romanian
    Principality, namely Moldavia. Historical anecdotes say he was
    actually a small fellow who founded a lot of churches, killed a
    shitload of Ottomans and fucked at least as many women. Historical
    jokes say most of the people from the historical region* are
    descendants of Stephen.
    
    \-\-\-  
    \* Including my mother's side of the family tree, for the record.

[^12]: Hunyadi Mátyás, also known as Matthias Corvinus, one of the
    greatest kings of Hungary, plus a couple of other joints. He had bit
    of a love-hate relationship with rulers from the Romanian
    Principalities, but most importantly, he beat the shit out of
    Ottoman armies on several occasions.

    Generally speaking though, the Hunyadis had quite an impact on
    Transylvania.

[^13]: Here the author either makes an enumeration of the two entities,
    i.e. the abstract entity named "the Romanian nation" and the
    entirety of its people, or he downright confuses the two. I can't
    tell.

[^14]: Clearly "with their arms weaponized" doesn't work too well in
    terms of poetry and it's not too precise in terms of meaning, while
    "with weapons in their arms" puts emphasis on the weapons rather
    than the people. So "arms armed" it is, no matter how funny and
    pleonastic it sounds.

[^15]: Awww, you thought Mel Gibson was the first to say that? How cute!

[^16]: The author seems to be deliberately vague here. On one hand he
    mentions the noble goal of fighting for freedom*, on the other he
    puts priests, who are supposed to be peaceful and all, in the first
    line.

    This means two things. The first, priests aren't exactly all that
    peaceful, since it's a tradition for Romanian soldiers to be blessed
    by priests, e.g. when they're going to fight abroad; in fact the
    church and the army were for a long while the two most trusted
    institutions in Romania. The second, the Romanian army rarely (if
    ever) fought to conquer, it almost always fought either in defense
    or as subordinate to higher powers.

    This is all accurate up to the present moment. You might think
    Tolkien was original and all, until you find out that Gandalf's
    famous Balrog phrase was (anecdotally) uttered by Romanian soldiers
    during the WWI Battle of Mărășești... only in that broken Latin we
    previously mentioned.

    \-\-\-  
    \* Yes, the very same noble goal those Middle-Eastern guys
      have... from their point of view, at least.

[^17]: Because, oh heck, I have to say it. Because socialism, especially
    the flavour practiced by Romanians -- not Ceaușescu, not the
    Communist Party, but the entire fucking mass of Romanians -- before
    December '89 had to work under the pretense that we're scientific,
    and developed, and words!
