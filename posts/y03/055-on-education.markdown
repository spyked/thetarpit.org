The (now-)traditional Romanian educational system can be traced back to
communist roots, where course matters in humanities consisted mostly of
useless Marxist shit dictated by the [Well-Doer][we], while the rather
difficult matter in sciences was dictated by Party politics in order to
raise scientists and engineers to compete with the guys in the West --
the ones who made the latest and greatest stuff and went into space and
all that. The result of this failed attempt at "progressive"
philo-socio-politics[^1] was the dumb political class of the '90s,
followed by the even dumber political class of the late 2000s and
2010s. But at least Romanians continue to have generations upon
generations of math olympics winners, at least until the few remaining
competent teachers die, like everything and everyone eventually does.

This phenomenon is not limited to Eastern Europe nor to a particular
level of scholarship, as demonstrated by the vast amounts of
bleeding-edge [academic hogwash][academic-hogwash] published throughout
the Western world. Moreover the subject is amply discussed in The Last
Psychiatrist's [Grade Inflation][grade-inflation]. "The system" has
failed because it forces little monkeys -- either through social
pressure or directly through the state's own machinery -- to waste their
time going through the we don't need no education system, getting those
As and ending up being awarded with a piece of paper that doesn't matter
anyway. And as Ballas points out, it's not the monkeys' fault:

So grade inflation is all "teachers' fault", and it's an important
factor contributing to "the system"'s degradation. There is however
another factor, that uncoincidentally is also "teachers' fault" at least
up to some degree, that is at least as important, namely those damned
curricula™.

<p style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold;">⁂</p>

Curricula have been the center of public debates on education in Romania
for a few decades now. I remember being in gymnasium and hearing people
whining that "kids nowadays aren't being taught practical stuff" and
"why do they have to study integrals, *they don't use them for nuthin'
anyway*"[^2]. It seemed like a big deal for Romanian idiots at the
time[^3], but what they didn't know was that the new "progressive"
politics imported from the West was no different from the old
"progressive" bullshit. Not only engineers had to be made, but they had
to be made faster.

An example of this curricula quackery -- but merely an example, for
worry not, the same quackery is nowadays abundant throughout the Western
world -- is what Europeans have called the Bologna Process. In Romania
this called for a shorter undergraduate academic cycle and faster
integration of to-be graduates in the industry, which led to faster
specialization, which is what everyone wanted anyway; "IT companies"
want more engineers while kids out of high-school wanna become
programmers-with-a-diploma[^4]. Meanwhile, square roots are considered
useless by the average high schooler, which is how Popescu came to write
his [La ce imi serveste mie radicalurile ?][radicalurili][^5]:

And because Romanian Computer Science students generally find control
theory to be a difficult subject, and because they mistake difficulty
for uselessness, I wrote a slightly controversed piece
[on the old blog][aplicabilitatea-practica] which has the same ring to
it. I'll note that I am probably one of the very few young people who
even bother considering the more conservative point of view of with
respect to this issue, while we've established a few paragraphs above
that the older conservatives are soon going to suffer literal rot
anyway. So what does this leave me with?

<p style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold;">⁂</p>

Basically what Popescu is saying is that knowing stuff, preferably stuff
written by people smarter than you on a topic that *may or may not* be
of direct interest to you enables you to think and do things that you
might otherwise be unable to, for example by giving you access to the
more secure, that is, the [less permeable][on-security] aspects of life.

By contrapositive, what I am stating is that one cannot in general
discuss a particular subject matter without first gnawing at its
fundaments, which is why Latin, control theory and lambda calculi are
not just important, but absolutely necessary for linguists, electrical
engineers and computer science graduates respectively, but more
generally for humans.

In case you're the CEO of an IT company and you're wondering why your
job candidates are more and more lacking in basic skills, consider the
possibility that it is at least partly your fault. While fungible
employees constitute a tempting proposition, hiring people while they're
still students will eat up their attention and distract them from
understanding the fundamental problems in the very same field as
you. Practical skills are necessary, but they're nothing next to the
power of force, which is the theoretical bullshit that you don't give a
fuck about. If all you want are meșters who cannot think for themselves,
then you're doing a pretty job at that. But also venture to guess the
long-term costs of hiring idiots instead of letting them finish their
studies in order to become less-overspecialized less-idiots.

You might think for example that studying the philosophical meaning of
computing is useless, since your employees know what a computer is since
we're all using them in our smartwatches and "they don't use them
theoretical thingamajiggs for nuthin' anyway". What you, as TLP's profs
and the profs that taught them, fail to see is that the notion of
computer is in fact rather vague. On one hand we have physical computers
which flip bits that are stored as electrical signals, while on the
other we have mathematical models which are disconnected from the
former, and heavens forbid you try to build a system that tries to break
the laws of physics.

I've been looking a lot at [operating systems][operating-systems] during
my master's and PhD studies, so I take some time to look at the OS
courses in my department and talk with the people giving the
lectures. "Systems" people are generally very pragmatic, but this
pragmatism is uncoincidentally also why Systems Software Research Is
Irrelevant[^6]. We define operating system processes as abstractions
involving "threads of execution" and "memory", while the notion of
process predates operating systems by a few centuries; computer programs
are running on physical computers, so why not view them as the set of
states that the computer-as-a-physical-system goes through? I guess
computer scientists are too keen on reinventing the universe.

<p style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold;">⁂</p>

Since we're discussing semantics, let us consider as an example the
meaning of the word "engineer". The word has the same roots as the
French "ingénieur"[^7], i.e. the Latin "ingenium", which describes the
notion of intelligence and, quite obviously, ingenuity. Thus engineers
are expected to be a sort of elites, highly intelligent who build upon
nature to innovate.

This etymological definition is however quite different from today's
circular definition of an engineer. People who aspired to the profession
of engineer needed to be trained in this sense, so engineering schools
were created, so somehow the initial meaning of engineer was perverted
to "person who graduates an engineering school".

In other words, the goals and purposes of today's engineering schools
are to form individuals who are graduates of engineering schools. I am
sure that other professions are nowadays being taught only for their own
sake, which is how academia became "a place where papers are published"
and the goal of software was reduced to
[writing more software][software-engineering-ii].

Can we thus state that education has become that proverbial snake
swallowing its own tail?

<p style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold;">⁂</p>

The ouroboros is also a metaphor for fields becoming some sort of
bubbles, more akin to [(post)-religion][post-religion] than to the
earthly trades that we sane humans are used to. While the classical
education used a holistic approach where the human was required to grasp
philosophy as well as mathematics, theology as well as chemistry,
physics as well as music, nowadays' "inter-disciplinary" approaches are
seen as some kind of hocus-pocus. If anything else isn't, it is clear
that overspecialized curricula are ruining "the system" as we know it.

Consider that many breakthroughs in physics, which in turned spawned
breakthroughs in engineering and brought you the computer in front of
which sits the average Facebookian on his fat ass, these breakthroughs
came about by changes in the underlying mathematics-as-philosophy. You
may laugh at Newton for theorizing that photons are spawned by God or
some other weird theory, but you most probably have troubles
conceptualizing simple particles such as electrons, which are a
fundamental part of the fabric of the universe.

Consider also that the DNA that is used by agricultors to serve you
food, and not to the next plague of insects, and to keep you from making
malformed babies, was discovered after many decades of studying biology
and chemistry, and that they essentially represent the computer code
which programs you to eat, fuck and learn.

Consider all of this and much, much more before uttering the
mind-boggingly stupid "they don't use them for nuthin' anyway". You
ain't got much time left [to become human][worth-to-humanity] before you
die, like everything and everyone eventually does.

[^1]: Because the old partisans educated either by the meanwhile failed
    Romanian monarchy or by the Soviets eventually died, like everything
    and everyone eventually does.

[^2]: "They don't use them for nuthin' anyway", a slightly fancier
    version of "ain't nobody got time fo' that" and a slightly accurate
    paraphrase of "la ce-mi servește mie radicalurili", is going to be
    the leitmotif of this essay. I bet you don't know what a leitmotif
    is; go bingle it, you fuckin' idiot.

[^3]: Including yours truly -- but hey, at least I was a *young idiot*
    back then, which is sort of an excuse, as people are known to be
    dumb by nature and in some cases become humans by means of
    <del>nurture</del> <del>beating</del> hard work. Not everyone
    survives this particular tar pit.

[^4]: As opposed to programmers without a diploma, which means more or
    less the same thing, only without the diploma. A shitty
    (un)professional remains a shitty (un)professional regardless of the
    titles given to him by insert random institution here. In other
    words, your CS degree is useless, news at eleven.

[^5]: Translation from broken Latin to retarded Newspeak is left as an
    exercise for the reader.

[^6]: This is the title of a famous talk ([pdf][pike]) given by Rob Pike
    quite a while before [Android][android] was a thing.

[^7]: From which the Romanian "inginer" was also born.
