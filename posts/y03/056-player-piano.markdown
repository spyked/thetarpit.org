Player Piano represents Vonnegut's attempt to predict the future, a
prediction which has proven to be mostly accurate with respect to
present day. Its ingredients are typically Vonnegutian in nature, at
least as far as I can tell; and I can't tell too much, since I've only
read Cat's Cradle in addition to this one. But let's stick to the
subject.

The first ingredient of the novel is maybe Vonnegut's obsession with the
war, or at least *a* war. War in general makes people go nuts, but this
war in particular coerced people, and in particular the so-called
"engineers and managers"[^1] into genuine ingenuity and whatnot. So the
second ingredient follows naturally: a post-war America with its social
particularities and peculiarities.

The third ingredient is a narrative told from a mostly-omni-scient point
of view, in fact comprising two (eventually) interweaving narrative
threads. Player Piano tells the story of Dr.[^2] Paul Proteus, "engineer
and manager", but as an aside provides an outside perspective through
the Shah of Bratpuhr, who just happens to be visiting the US during the
unfolding of the novel's main events. The Shah and his nephew, and in
fact the whole thread is a plot device created to illustrate that
America's "progress" is for naught[^3].

The fourth ingredient is satire. Satire of American democracy, satire of
"progressive" "liberal" socialism, satire of [endless PR][marketing],
and, the most visionary and the best of them all, satire of "computers
will make the world a better place"[^4]. To quote:

> "This is EPICAC XIV," said Halyard. "It's an electronic computing

and I could go on for a long time with this.

The climax of the whole story is reached when a bunch of derps delude
themselves that they can change "the system" by throwing a
revolution. And they do, and the coup sort of succeeds, that is, until
[the slaves][freedom] start going back to the initial process of making
their own lives miserable. Other than that, Vonnegut might have gone
wrong in a place or two; I don't remember exactly where and how, so that
makes it mostly unimportant.

To sum this up, the novel is recommended reading for those who don't
understand why we sane people don't want to run Windows and rely on
Google, Wikipedia and "on [the Cloud][cloud-software]" in general. To
further sum it up, Vonnegut's novel is a nice story of how technology is
fundamentally a tool of oppression, and he who controls it is invested
with a great amount of power, at least until it all fails.

[^1]: Had Vonnegut published Player Piano as his last novel in the
    2000s, instead of his first in the '50s, he could have called them
    "CTOs and CEOs" or some other equally boring Newspeak
    designation. Fortunately for him, he expired shortly before the
    2010s came about.

[^2]: They're all Doctors and whatchamacallthem over there.

[^3]: What is Bratpuhr, and who are the Kolhouri, you ask? Well, as
    fictional as they are, they also serve to emphasize a certain
    misconception of the USian ilk, that on one hand there's America,
    and on the other there's the rest of the Third World, with no Second
    World in-between worth knowing and exploring to the
    averager. Bratpuhr is, like Romania or Papua New Guinea, a sort of
    soup: there's no oil there, and thus no need for them to be
    "civilized"* by the "civilized"* Western folk.
    
    \-\-\-  
    \* By which I mean, in the words of the great Frank Zappa,
       overeducated shitheads.

[^4]: With variations such as "Make America Great Again" and whatever
    else you will.

[^5]: Research, like in today's "big data", "analytics", "data science",
    machine "learning", etc., etc. Basically all the tools required to
    reduce the average person to a [statistical model][google-stupid].

[^6]: In case you were wondering, this is exactly how the so-called
    movie and music industries have been working in the last five
    decades or so. But-but-but, what about the Beatles and the Pink
    Floyds, the King Crimsons and the Frank Zappas spawned by these
    industries? you will ask.

    Sure, these were honest outliers, but the only thing their success
    did was to further the idiotic belief that there is a recipe to
    create art. This is of course a clear semantic contradiction, since
    art is by definition [the very best there is][on-art] and
    [culture][on-security] is by definition that which distinguishes
    [humans from sheep][humanity]. Once the best becomes accessible to
    the masses, it stops being the best, "the best being accessible"
    being itself a paradox.

    As somewhat of a side note, the quote can also be interpreted as
    machines becoming the actual creators of art, which is fashionable
    nowadays with Google using data-based techniques to imitate poetry,
    music and whatnot.
