Despre Oameni și Melci[^1] is a practical illustration of our previous
discussion [on the unfairness of nature][slither], taking place in the
setting of early post-communist Romania. Which sets the premise for an
interesting story.

You see, if you're a Romanian, then you should understand that,
regardless of what those other socialists would have you believe, the
2017 nationalist agenda of the children of the
[Romanian Communist Party][tezele] -- that is, PSD, ex-PDSR, ex-FSN,
ex-paștele pizdii mamii lor de viermi împuțiți[^2] -- is not entirely
baseless. About a decade and a half before that hopeful beginning
consisting of promises on which the EU dream[^3] didn't deliver, at
least for some... well, about a decade and a half before that, Romanians
were being fed the same kind of concocted promises of freedom coming
right after the dictator's bloody death[^4]. This so-called freedom
meant "we want the Americans to come and give us their cocks" and
"Americans" meant pretty much everyone from the West.

Thus, the act of destruction depicted in the movie was conceived,
prepared and executed by two sides: the Romanian side, represented by
Vladimir (Vișan), and the American side, represented by two Frenchies
(Stévenin and son) who want to exploit the opportunities offered by this
new banana republic, namely to make sure that the small Aro Câmpulung
plant stays down and gets sold piece by piece of scrap metal[^5].

Their plan is almost -- but not quite -- thwarted by an otherwise smart
wannabe influencer cum union leader, George (Vasluianu), who comes up
with the not-entirely-bad idea of buying the plant. But not in any
conventional way, oh no: his proposal is to crowdfund the acquisition by
having the workers cash off sperm donation. This is where the pure,
unadulterated Romanian comedy part comes in. Really, there's nothing
more amusing than a bunch of guys -- some of them young, most of them in
their forties -- trying to save the company by donating their seed to
Western families[^6], while their conservative wives are all outraged by
this heresy. And unlike depicted in bad Hollywood movies, the business
proposition fails because that's just how the story goes.

The rest of the Romanian parts are also as Romanian as they could be:
the French teacher wants to impress the Frenchies communist-style, but
fails; Manuela (Bârlădeanu) studied her telenovella Spanish and her
mother makes great jam, which Frenchie son likes, so he gives the girl
the opportunity of her life, anyway, certainly better than being
George's fuckgirl; George herds the derp-flock made up of company "men";
Romanians are unimpressed by them fancy snails; and, among others,
Romanians are easily impressed by him Michael Jackson -- piece by piece,
exactly what you'd expect from a minor culture trying to assimilate into
itself that of the conquerors.

And this about sums it all up: ever since the beginning of time[^7], for
each Romanian who attempted to do something productive, there were seven
others who sat and watched doing nothing, and two others who conspired
the former's demise... or something like that.

[^1]: Englishized as "Of Snails And Men", though I'd say it's rather Of
    Men and Snails. 2012, directed by Tudor Giurgiu and written by Ionuț
    Teianu. Starring Dorel Vișan, Andi Vasluianu, Monica Bârlădeanu and
    some French guys.

[^2]: I couldn't possibly express that in today's English, and I don't
    know enough of Shakespeare's variety to write down a proper
    equivalent; and besides, you wouldn't understand anyway.

[^3]: A dream entirely concocted by Romanians, mind you.

[^4]: To quote:

    > **Vladimir**: Remember how you did during the Revolution?  
    > **George**: How we did what?  
    > **Vladimir**: You gathered here in front of the plant
    > (gesticulates): free-dom! free-dom!  
    > **Vladimir**: Well, you got it.

[^5]: This was a common occurence in 1990s Romania. Why? Well, I'll hand
    the mic over to the economists to give an explanation of the
    phenomenon.

[^6]: To quote:

    > **Ion**: Good night.  
    > **Carmen**: (Playful.) Are you tired?  
    > **Ion**: No, but y'know, tomorrow I'm going with the boys at
    > Bucharest.  
    > **Carmen**: Oh, I know-I know-I know...  
    > **Ion**: Nighty... (resisting:) wait! C'mon, you know I can't! You
    > know that very well! It was very clear in those questionnaires, what
    > the heck.  
    > **Carmen**: I know, but c'mon, just a little, those guys won't
    > catch on so easily.  
    > **Ion**: I can't... Don't you understand?  
    > **Ion**: Woman, we need to save that plant, what the heck!  
    > **Carmen**: (Upset.) You don't love me anymore.  
    > **Ion**: I do love you. But I can't do it tonight. I'm working for
    > export.  

[^7]: Read up on some Romanian folklore sometime. It's not bad at all.
