(Disclaimer: the alternative to these facts is unbearable.)

They say that humans are smarter than machines, but that a machine can
never -- at least for some particular meanings of never -- go wrong,
while a human could easily be stupid enough to believe that two plus two
equals five -- at least for some particular meanings of two, plus and
five.

But that is obviously a gross misunderstanding. One can as easily
convince a machine that two plus two equals five, as follows. Define a
function called "my plus", which takes as arguments two items a and b,
whose implementation is the following. If a is two and b is two, then
equals five; else equals whatever the machine implicitly understands a
plus b means in the machine's narrow view of the world. See? easy.

But then, how to convince a human that two plus two equals five? In
precisely the same way.

Machines, ever the perfect slaves.
