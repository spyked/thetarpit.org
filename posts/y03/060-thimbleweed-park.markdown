<p style="text-align: right">*There appears to be a small hole in the
back of the head, origins unknown...  
The hole in the victim's head doesn't look like a gunshot,  
more like a puncture from a sharp object...  
Which is odd because the opening title sequence clearly showed a gunshot  
with accompanying sound effect...*</p>

Thimbleweed Park is that nostalgic outcry of the old fart '80s computer
programmer that he once made games and earned some money from it, so
thirty years later he'd like to give it another shot. That, and an
attempt to educate today's kids about how cool
[point-and-click verb-based adventure games][dott] used to be back in
the day. That, and pretty clearly a hand extended towards Maniac Mansion
fans, given that it's marketed as its spiritual successor.

From an artistic point of view, things look as follows. Ron Gilbert and
Gary Winnick took the late '80s-early '90s pop culture and tried to cram
most of it, and a satire thereof, in a video game. It's 1987, you
see. And a man is killed, you see. And there's not one, but two FBI
agents (a chick and a guy, whaddaya know!) on the case. And the
atmosphere throughout the entire setting -- Thimbleweed Park, a shadow
of a former glory of the pillow-making industry -- is eerie, you
see. Hard to comprehend if you haven't lived through those times' TV
shows, but otherwise this is one of the rare cases where the utter lack
of originality actually adds to the artistry.

Later on we find out that there are actually four, or about five,
in-game player characters, all contributing to the story. We're not
quite sure which one of them is *the* centerpiece of our game, but it
doesn't matter, because this being a comedy, the story isn't supposed to
make sense. Even so, the thick of the story is very interesting --
there's mystery, and there is a ton of humour of all kinds -- but
unfortunately the conclusion is a fourth wall mess that satirizes
itself. Or anyway, it seems that the writers didn't want to lead the
storytelling anywhere than in a hollow. I don't know what to make of
this.

From the point of view of game design, the game sits in the exact same
place as [Day of The Tentacle][dott-again]. It's like most of the
puzzles were made on purpose to keep the player brute-forcing, which in
my masochism I really enjoyed, not least because the game offers a lot
of possibilities for exploring and discovering various trivia. I was
expecting it to be more frustrating for the weekend gamer, but it's
actually not.

The neo-pixelated '90s graphics style is absolutely gorgeous. The
in-game disco music is a-musing, while the background music is pretty
damn good, probably inspired from Twin Peaks. I've absolutely nothing to
object on the technical side; whatever game engine they used, I hope
it's used in other games, because the lack of a single bug in a
post-2010 Linux game is quite the rarity.

I am somewhat inclined to compare Thimbleweed Park to
[Broken Age][broken-age], not from any technical or artistic point of
view, but rather from the point of view of the promises made to fans. I
think Gilbert and Winnick have done much a better job than their
ex-colleague Tim Schafer in getting a game out. They seem to have kept
it simple, or at least *simpler* to a degree, in developing this game,
and they haven't set the highest expectation possible for their
Kickstarter backers, which in my opinion makes this a successful
gamble. It's not like Thimbleweed shines in any way, not in the absolute
and not in comparison to other adventure games, but I'd recommend this
to anyone, while Broken Age... I don't know, I haven't even had the
patience to bring it to a proper conclusion myself.

So, let it be known that I recommend Thimbleweed Park to anyone, be they
hardcore gamers or weekend gamers or non-gamers. It's worth a weekend or
two, and then another weekend or two after a couple of years... and then
another one. Because, as the agents'-a-reno-a-who-a-boo saying goes:
