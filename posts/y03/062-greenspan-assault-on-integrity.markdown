Alan Greenspan is a well-known and supposedly knowledgeable economist
from the United States; supposedly, not unquestionably, for two
reasons. The first reason is that while I'm not an economist myself, I
fancy myself a thinker -- and hopefully more than just fancy, but I'll
leave this judgment to thinkers -- and as a supposed thinker, I am not
convinced. The second reason is history itself, more precisely the
unquestionable fact that under Greenspan's long-lived leadership of the
Federal Reserve, the US suffered blow after blow economically, from the
ongoing "tech bubble" started in the late 1990s to the recession of
2008.

But instead of trying to answer such nonsensical questions as "was
Greenspan a good economist?", we will attempt a practical exercise in
understanding the man, by commenting on a text he published more than
twenty years before he started playing with federal money
policies. Below you have a copy of The Assault on Integrity, published
in August 1963 in The Objectivist Newsletter, later republished and
edited by Ayn Rand, etc., and now annotated by yours truly.

But how is this so-called "greed" measured? For their pretended
adherence to science, said regulatory agencies are markedly lacking in
rigorousness with respect to their claims. How do we quantify greed? By
measuring profits? But any rational (and thus self-interested) agent
will try to make a profit. By measuring the amount of people with
E. coli infections? But that could be explained in a million other ways
(say, incompetence). Which drives us towards the point that intent does
not matter one bit in the interaction between economic -- or political,
for that matter -- actors[^1].

So, you see, it's not what you intend to do that matters, but what you
have done so far to deserve sitting at the discussion table. It's
basically just acting
[from causes, not towards purposes][cauze-si-scopuri]. In other words,
Greenspan proposes the Web of Trust as a form of organization.

No argument here, at least that's how business works in the civilized
world, as opposed to the troglodyte tribes of McDonaldia. Greenspan's
explanation is plain, but this does not explain why socialists prefer
regulation (that is, a boot stamping on a human face, forever, to quote
Orwell) over reputation. Let's read on.

> Government regulation is not an alternative means of protecting the
> consumer. It does not build quality into goods, or accuracy into

> basis of regulation is armed force. At the bottom of the endless pile

> the results?

Greenspan identifies the three basic constituents of any and every
totalitarian state: a bureaucracy to "make the policies"
([freedom is slavery][freedom-is-slavery]), a circus to keep people
distracted while gathering intelligentia in the field (ignorance is
strength) and an armed force to dispose of inconvenient adversaries (war
is peace).

More precisely, socialists identify that
[at the bottom of the food chain][slither] there squirms a category of
people (most likely themselves) who are not equipped intellectually to
make a choice. Given this, the former propose making a choice for the
latter, but since this would be discriminatory and all, they in fact
propose making a choice for everyone, including those who can and who
would otherwise prefer making a choice for themselves. Nevermind that
people are not "equal" by any standards except biological ones (and very
often not even those), and nevermind that this doesn't work in practice
-- this is *exactly* what the regulators in question will propose[^3].

The results? People who are not equipped to choose will still be unable
to choose, while those who at least have a potential in this sense will
be disincentivised to learn how to make a choice. Meanwhile, people who
can and want to make a choice other than the one officially approved by
the committee of proper-choice-making will find it harder to do so than
if there were no committee at all. You do the math on that.

That isn't to say that minimum standards aren't appropriate in high-risk
contexts such as nuclear plants and buildings in areas with high seismic
activity -- Taleb has the details on risk and fragility, refer to him
for further details. However, this is orders of magnitude removed from
what ecologists have done with light bulbs and the automotive market, to
give only a couple of examples of an unsustainable planned economy
model.

Either way, minimum standards aren't established so much for statal
entities to enforce as they are for interested parties to use for
verification. Any standard is useless unless the one who pays can verify
compliance.

That is precisely so. And sometimes prevention is necessary. But it's
not necessary unless it's necessary, and please to not underplay the
meaning of "necessary".

Greenspan's rhetoric is subtly propagandistic here. The property of any
of the items in discussion of being new, modern and whatnot is not
relevant. Coincidentally, in the field he mentions (among others), it
may take years to prove that a new technology is also safer, during
which said technology will have stopped being new.

It may be that he is referring to a particular policy related to
construction. "Any material is permitted that withstands a force of x
meganewtons per square meter and has the elasticity coefficient y, etc."
is a decent policy; at the same time "any material is permitted that is
one of alloys x, y and z" is a shitty policy, because construction
materials may indeed change easily in time, while wind pressure, soil
types, etc. are mostly invariant in a given place. Or if we're not able
to comprehend the science behind buildings, we should rather leave that
to those who do, shouldn't we?

Moreover, even letting aside risk factors, a badly engineered building
is easy to build and hard to demolish, and even if clients make the
choice of putting the construction company out of business, the town
will be left with an unused building that wastes real estate space,
which is a pretty scarce resource. So it's not all that evil for the
town to hamper trigger-happy constructors from trying to reach their
(potentially overinflated) projections.

That's a very good observation. Inasmuch as the town doesn't act
unequivocally, trigger-happy constructors will have no problems buying
the right people in the right places -- just in case you thought "lupta
împotriva corupției"[^4] was anything but gargle.

The crux of this particular problem is that not only is economic agents'
reputation devalued, but bureaucrats themselves are not subject to a
judgment of their reputation. By Constitution, each n years a bunch of
people are elected, which may or may not lead to some bureaucrat or
another taking the office in another's stead[^5]. How does the reputable
constructor know that the new bureaucrat isn't just there to get him?
Or, as it happens in Romania's case, what do you do when you know that
the newly-instated bureaucrats are there specifically to put down their
adversaries and not for any sort of imagined public interest?

Meanwhile, note that a bunch of decades later, Greenspan helped grow
exactly that sad state of affairs which he decries in this essay. So,
what next?

Next is not exactly much. Since we've remembered Orwell, we remark that
he was correct in his prediction that "the proles" cannot come to have
anything even faintly resembling political awareness[^6]. That said, it
is ridiculous to believe that the boot can stamp the [human][humanity]
face forever; the human will continue to live much despite this attack
on integrity, and long after the unsustainable etatist will have rotten.

[^1]: Samsung might or might not have intended to sell phones that blow
    up, but regardless of Samsung's intention, terrorists might have
    used them to their own purposes in airports.

    Speaking of which, why do so-called terrorists blow up people in
    airports? Is it, as they say on BBC, "senseless violence", or is it
    really trying to purify the souls of Westerner heathens? And, more
    importantly, does that really matter, as long as they kill a hundred
    and instill fear in millions of others?

[^2]: Did he mean "its"? This one looks like an OCR misscan.

[^3]: The anecdote goes that in Sweden, (at least some) university
    campuses give students a free coffee each afternoon. Nevermind that
    some of them don't drink coffee, and nevermind that producing coffee
    comes with a cost, here's your free coffee, signed and approved by
    the committee of coffee-giving.

    In Romania a while ago there was a similar much-derided programme
    for public schools called "cornul și laptele" (the croissant and the
    milk). I don't know what happened to that, but yes, it was the local
    socialists' doing.

[^4]: I.e. the fight against corruption, a very common phrase in Romania
    nowadays.

[^5]: In communist Romania they called this "rotația cadrelor", in the
    USSR they called it "ротация кадров" and so on.
